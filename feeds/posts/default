&lt;p&gt;This is the ninth in a series of posts about my East Coast US trip in March 2013 (see the &lt;a href="http://blog.dominickng.com/2013/04/east-coast-i-pitstop-in-detroit.html"&gt;first part&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://blog.dominickng.com/2013/05/east-coast-ii-washington-dc-day-1.html"&gt;second part&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://blog.dominickng.com/2013/05/east-coast-iii-washington-dc-day-2.html"&gt;third part&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://blog.dominickng.com/2013/05/east-coast-iv-new-york-part-1.html"&gt;fourth part&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://blog.dominickng.com/2013/06/east-coast-v-new-york-part-2.html"&gt;fifth part&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://blog.dominickng.com/2013/06/east-coast-vi-new-york-part-3.html"&gt;sixth part&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://blog.dominickng.com/2013/08/east-coast-vii-new-york-part-4.html"&gt;seventh part&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://blog.dominickng.com/2013/09/east-coast-viii-new-york-part-5.html"&gt;eighth part&lt;/a&gt;). Boston, Massachusetts is one of the oldest cities in the United States, having been founded in 1630. I loved the city and my time there, but my memories are tinged by the horror of the &lt;a href="http://blog.dominickng.com/2013/04/terror-and-usa.html"&gt;Boston Marathon bombings&lt;/a&gt;, which occurred just a fortnight after I left the city. Still, I highly recommend a visit for anyone travelling through the northeast United States.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It was with some sadness that I packed up on my last evening in New York. Bidding my lovely host Dee farewell for now, I trekked to Penn Station to board an Amtrak service to Boston. Amtrak is the interstate passenger train service in the United States, and operates through most of the mainland. However, the quality, quantity, and speed of Amtrak pales in comparison to the incredible train services of countries across Europe and East Asia. Many parts of the country see only one or two services per day; the rise of the automobile in the 20th century coupled with the constructed of the National Highway System led to a precipitous decline in the popularity of rail services that continues to this day. The one true bright spot in the Amtrak network is the densely populated Northeast Corridor from Washington D.C. to Boston; over half of Amtrak's revenue comes from this route, and it was here where I took a 4 hour train ride from New York to Boston.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC00344.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The train ride was smooth and on-time, running north along the Connecticut and Rhode Island coastlines before cutting inland into Massachusetts and Boston. The trip cost approximately $50 thanks to a very early booking - Amtrak offers substantial savings if you reserve a ticket several weeks in advance of your trip. I had an unreserved ticket, meaning I could board the train and choose whichever seat took my fancy. The train is comfortable, not overcrowded, and power and food service is available on board. All in all, a very pleasant way to travel.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC00362.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before long, the train was pulling into the terminus at Boston South Station. I transferred onto the metro system (called the T), heading slightly west towards Cambridge, where I would be staying with my friend Steph. Steph worked for a consulting company, and I had met her a year previous when she had spent a work exchange in the Sydney office. She had very kindly offered to let me stay for a couple of nights whilst I was in the area. On top of that, she also took time out to take me around the city a little. A quick walk from her apartment led to the Boston Common and Boston Public Gardens, which are adjoining parks near the centre of the city. Whilst Boston is notorious for its heavy snowfalls and long, cold winters, this leg of the trip featured the best weather: glorious sunshine and blue skies. It was a great day for a walk in the park.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC00370.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crossing the park, Steph and I continued strolling into the city itself. I can't emphasise enough how nice Boston is to walk through in spring. The city is spacious and inviting, with wide-open paths and moderate traffic. I was definitely absorbing the sunshine following a week of sporadic light, heavy snow, and chilly winds. Boston is historic, playing a key role in the American Revolution, and then serving as an important cultural, manufacturing, and naval centre. Signs of this history are everywhere around the city; I would cover more of them on my second day when I walked the Freedom Trail.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/IMG_0760.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Skirting through Downtown and the Financial District, Steph and I crossed over the Fort Point Channel on a rail bridge now converted for pedestrians. This area of Boston formerly served as an industrial hub, but is being gradually reclaimed and redeveloped by the city. Our destination was The Barking Crab, a waterfront restaurant featuring a lively bar, great atmosphere, and classic New England seafood fare. The area is known for fishing, and American comfort foods such as clam chowder and lobster rolls abound here. Boston is also home to the Boston Brewing Company and Samuel Adams beer, and so my lunch consisted of a beer and a delicious lobster roll. Whilst my lobster came pre-prepared, one could also order fresh - the enormous specimen above was proudly conveyed through the restaurant prior to being served.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC00382.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following lunch, we strolled back towards the city centre, and I bid Steph goodbye for the time being. She had some errands to run that afternoon, and I would continue exploring the city by myself. We parted near the New England Holocaust Memorial, inspired by survivors of the terrible World War II atrocities who found new lives and homes in the Boston area. There Memorial consists of a number of glass towers, each symbolising one of the concentration camps. The outer walls of each tower are engraved with numbers representing the six million victims of the Holocaust, and quotes are inscribed onto the inner walls. The poignant words of Martin Niemoller particularly struck me:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First they came for the communists,&lt;br /&gt;
and I didn't speak out because I wasn't a communist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then they came for the socialists,&lt;br /&gt;
and I didn't speak out because I wasn't a socialist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then they came for the trade unionists,&lt;br /&gt;
and I didn't speak out because I wasn't a trade unionist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then they came for me,&lt;br /&gt;
and there was no one left to speak for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC00389.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having had my fill of the east of Boston, I jumped on the T to head west, towards Copley Square and the McKim building of the Boston Public Library. The first public library system in the country (even older than New York's), the Library was established in 1848, and continues to operate as both a research and a circulatory library. Entry is free, and as the photo above testifies, the building is richly decorated inside. It is cool and quiet - a world away from the bustling Square outside. Housed within is an extensive art collection, and some of it is displayed on the upper floors of the building. A centrepiece consisting of a rich set of dioramas by Louis Stimson was particularly memorable; each one depicted artists in the midst of painting their most famous works. Richly detailed in miniature, it's worth the trek up the stairs to the top of the building.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC00396.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Opposite the Public Library on the other side of Copley Square is the beautiful Trinity Church. Built in the 1870's, the church looms large over the square, its imposing edifice being the influence for a generation of buildings across the United States. Weekly services continue in the church to this day, and it often serves host to special services honouring significant national events or tragedies. The square adjoins the busy Boylston Street, and it was along this street, just a few blocks from Copley Square where the marathon bombs exploded on April 15th 2013. The street is a busy commercial avenue, running parallel to the Charles River and adjacent to the Boston Common and Public Garden at its north eastern terminus. I followed the road to the south west, enjoying the atmosphere of hundreds of New Englanders breaking out from a long winter.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC00406.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This terrifically impressive building is the The First Church of Christ, Scientist - Mother Church of the religion of the same name. I stumbled upon it along Massachusetts Avenue, having turned south of Boylston near the famous Berklee College of Music (the "other" Berkeley!). It is this organisation from which the excellent news publication, the &lt;em&gt;Christian Science Monitor&lt;/em&gt; originates from; the church's founder had purportedly grown tired of the sensationalism and scandal dominating the news media of the late 1800's (as well as the adverse coverage of her new religion), and decided to establish her own publication to "injure no man, but to bless all mankind". While I'm somewhat nonplussed at the religion, which counts spiritual healing through prayer among its tenets, I do appreciate the thoughtful and insightful stories that I read from the &lt;em&gt;Monitor&lt;/em&gt;. In the 1960's, the adjoining Christian Science Plaza was built by I.M. Pei &amp;amp; Associates, featuring a reflecting pool and fountain that were unfortunately disabled during my visit (presumably as we were still too shortly out from winter).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC00448.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Across the Charles River to the west of Boston is the city of Cambridge, home to two of the great universities of the United States: the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), and Harvard University. In addition, the city features campuses of Tufts University, Boston College, Boston University, Wellesley College, Northeastern University, and the Berklee School of Music - just to name a few! Backtracking along Massachusetts Avenue, I crossed onto the bridge fording the Charles River to pay a visit to MIT. The walk is beautiful - the river is a rich blue, calm as a sheet, with boats of all kinds out en masse. The cityscape glittered in the afternoon sunshine, betraying nothing of the harsh winter which had just passed. Boston is not a tall city, and feature substantial greenery, which adds to its charm. If only it were like this all year (as it is in Sydney!), then I would have no problems living here. Such natural beauty in a harbour city is hard to come by.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC00418.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Massachusetts Avenue deposits you directly into MIT, and one of the first buildings you see is the home of the architecture school. Now, university architecture buildings in my experience are hideous. Both Sydney University and UC Berkeley featured ugly concrete and brick contraptions housing students learning to design buildings. Sometimes I wonder if this is a deliberate measure to provide inspiration for budding architects (i.e. "don't design a building that looks like this"). Thankfully, MIT's architecture building is stunning - Greco-Roman columns, elegant steps, and an imposing edifice. This is what I call inspiring architecture.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC00426.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Around a few more corners from architecture leads you to the famous Stata Center, whose chaotic, almost teetering and unfinished look was designed by celebrated architect Frank Gehry. This building houses computer science, philosophy, and linguistics, as well as the luminaries Noam Chomsky, Tim Berners-Lee (inventor of the internet), and Richard Stallman (leader of the free software movement GNU). Sadly, it was near the Stata Center where MIT Patrol Officer Sean Collier was slain in his car on a night of mayhem in Boston following the marathon bombings.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fun fact: MIT sued Gehry a few years after the 2004 completion of the Stata Center for providing "deficient design services and drawings" that led to leaky roofs, cracked masonry, and various other problems. The case was settled, but not before Gehry dryly noted that "there are things that were left out of the design - the client chose not to put certain devices on the roofs, to save money". Ouch!  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC00442.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This beautiful building is the Barker Engineering Library, and it is topped by the MIT Great Dome. There is a curious practice of referring to buildings by number at MIT; the Stata Center is Building 32, while Barker is Building 10. Nos. 1 through 10 (except 9) were part of the original MIT campus; with its classic Ionic columns, Barker originally served as the primary entrance to the campus. While the numbering system may seem symptomatic of an overly engineered mindset, the numbers are logically assigned and correlate with location, and thus it is said that members of the MIT community can approximately identify where any building on campus must be given its number - certainly a convenience that I would appreciate! The number of times that I've had to give someone directions to a building that bears only an unhelpful name around Sydney and Berkeley is astounding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC00508.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Darkness was now beginning to fall, and so I made my way back to Steph's apartment to sit down for a bit. For dinner, I went to a sports bar with Steph, her boyfriend, and a few of their friends. My travels had come in the midst of 'March Madness' - the annual college basketball final championships. College sports are enormous in the US, and practically the entire nation is consumed by the finals. We watched one of the games as we enjoyed typical American comfort food and beer for dinner. It was a lovely end to a lovely day.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Boston"></category><category term="Massachusetts"></category><category term="USA"></category><category term="Travel"></category></entry><entry><title>East Coast (VIII): New York, Part 5</title><link href="http://dominickng.com/blog/2013/09/east-coast-viii-new-york-part-5/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2013-09-15T00:00:00+10:00</updated><author><name>Dominick Ng</name></author><id>tag:dominickng.com,2013-09-15:blog/2013/09/east-coast-viii-new-york-part-5/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This is the eighth in a series of posts about my East Coast US trip in March 2013 (see the &lt;a href="http://blog.dominickng.com/2013/04/east-coast-i-pitstop-in-detroit.html"&gt;first part&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://blog.dominickng.com/2013/05/east-coast-ii-washington-dc-day-1.html"&gt;second part&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://blog.dominickng.com/2013/05/east-coast-iii-washington-dc-day-2.html"&gt;third part&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://blog.dominickng.com/2013/05/east-coast-iv-new-york-part-1.html"&gt;fourth part&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://blog.dominickng.com/2013/06/east-coast-v-new-york-part-2.html"&gt;fifth part&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://blog.dominickng.com/2013/06/east-coast-vi-new-york-part-3.html"&gt;sixth part&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://blog.dominickng.com/2013/08/east-coast-vii-new-york-part-4.html"&gt;seventh part&lt;/a&gt;).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My last day in New York came far too quickly. For all that I had seen and done, I had not even managed to venture out of Manhattan before my time in the city was up. I would spend this last day crossing the final few things off my list, and wishing for the next trip to this great city to arrive quickly.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My day began at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The Met, as it is affectionately known, is the largest art gallery in the US. It sits on Museum Mile on the east edge of Central Park, and I had already walked by it several times during my time in the city. I finally entered to explore its cavernous halls on this last day in the city. You need not pay to enter if you do not want to, but there are recommended amounts for adults, students, and children which I dutifully followed. Please pay the recommended amount when you go - the museum is well worth the price and much more. The halls sprawl on and on with art and relics of every imaginable kind and origin. It is like walking through the history of the world in one building.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC00165.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I arrived at the Museum before opening time, and was one of the first people to enter. This meant that I was able to wander through an almost deserted Met Museum for nearly an hour as people began filing inside. It was a very pleasant experience, and I recommend an early arrival to anyone who wishes to visit the Met. One of the most stunning exhibits there is a complete Egyptian temple. The Temple of Dendur originally sat on the banks of the Nile in Egypt. However, the construction of the Aswan High Dam in the 1960s threatened to submerge the temple. American money was pledged to help save the temple from destruction, and in gratitude the Egyptian Government gifted the historic site to the US. It was moved and reconstructed in the Met Museum, where it still sits in an enormous room surrounded by a pool symbolising the Nile.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC00172.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Charles Engelhard Court in the American Wing of the Museum is a beautiful, airy space in which a collection of American sculpture is displayed. The centrepiece (behind the lamppost to the left of of the photo above) is a beautiful golden-gilded &lt;em&gt;Diana&lt;/em&gt;, by Augustus Saint-Gaudens. She stands 13 feet high, balancing on one foot, drawing back an arrow in a bow. The centrality of the Court means that you can pass by it many times over the course of your Met trip; it adjoins the Temple of Dendur, the American Wing, Medieval Arms and Armour, and the European section on the first floor.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC00192.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Met Museum's website lists some recommendations for the viewer in a hurry. One of these is the above Power Figure, sourced from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. These figures are sculpted to hold mystical forces, and serve as witnesses to important vows, treaties, and exorcisms in the community. Each metal spike driven into the body of the figure symbolises another critical affair witnessed and performed under its watchful eye. Intimidating, isn't it?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC00194.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The beautiful frescoes of this restored bedroom are taken from the villa of one P. Fannius Synistor. The villa was in Boscoreale, about a mile north of Pompeii, and was buried following the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in A.D. 79. Excavated in the early twentieth century, the villa's frescoes were restored and are now on display in their approximate original configuration in the Met. I think frescoes are fascinating because of the way in which they are painted: plaster is laid down, and then the paint applied as the plaster is still drying. This imbues the image into the plaster, making it an integral part of the wall.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC00207.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Met houses a very large collection of art, including many works from my favourite Impressionist era. Above is a van Gogh entitled &lt;em&gt;'Wheat Field with Cypresses'&lt;/em&gt;. Painted just a year before van Gogh committed suicide, the work is remarkable to see up close. A picture cannot do justice to the thickness of the layers of paint - the coarse brushstrokes that look so uncouth in individuality but as a whole combine to illustrate a placid, pastoral scene.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC00231.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;William Bouguereau's &lt;em&gt;'Nymphs and Satyr'&lt;/em&gt; caused a storm of controversy upon its debut in Paris, 1873. The painting was acquired by an American art collector, sold at auction in 1888, and then bought again in 1901 whereupon it was stored in a warehouse to keep its 'offensive' content from the public. The Met is currently displaying the painting while its original home at the Clark Art Institute in Massachusetts undergoes renovations. What is the offensive content you may ask? It's a group of nymphs bathing in a pond who have been disturbed by a lascivious satyr. Granted, the painting is enormous - 260cm by 180cm, and it dominates a wall all by itself. But in today's day and age, the content hardly seems controversial - how times change.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC00239.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jackson Pollock was a hugely influential American artist of the twentieth century. Known for his distinctive drip-painting style, Pollock's most famous works look like chaos - swirls, drips, lines, and turns of paint spread seemingly random on huge canvases. The above painting is part of the Met's contemporary collection, and is entitled &lt;em&gt;'Autumn Rhythm (Number 30)'.&lt;/em&gt; Though I stared at it for a while, I couldn't quite find the sense of grounding and space that purportedly makes the work evocative of nature. I'm sure it's there somewhere though.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC00255.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I wound up my time in the Met, I swung by the musical instrument section on the 2nd floor. As a pianist, I studied music theory for six years, and I attend several classical concerts a year. A substantial component of musical theory covers the history of instruments, and how they have evolved over time to their modern forms. As many instruments age, their sound improves, and this is why so many musicians play on instruments constructed in the 17th and 18th centuries. Perhaps there is no type of instrument more famous than a Stradivarius violin. The exemplar sound of these instruments has led to the term "Stradivarius" becoming a synonym for excellence, and today these violins fetch millions of dollars. The Met has two beautiful examples on display of the approximately 600 that survive today.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC00291.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The previous day, Camilla and I had agreed to go see a Broadway show together. The plan was for me to go to the TKTS discount booth in Times' Square, and acquire two tickets to an appropriate show. The booth sells excess, unsold tickets for a discount on the day of performance, and you can usually get close to a 50% discount (though your selection is typically limited). I left the Met, and wandered across Central Park towards the nearest subway station to get to Times Square. This gave me an opportunity to see the square during the day time to contrast my previous experience very late at night. Despite the overcast weather, the square was thoroughly packed with people - mostly tourists - who were milling around enjoying the atmosphere. There's an interactive screen which beams back a live video feed of the crowd - a welcome piece of humanity amongst the hyper-kinetic rainbow of dazzling, shimmering billboards advertising shows, perfumes, cars, and sports. Times Square is uniquely American - a tribute to consumerism, information overload, populated with hundreds of people from all over the world - many of whom aren't quite sure what they're doing or why they're doing it, but certainly enjoying the spectacle of life around them.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC00299.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I arrived at the TKTS booth around 2pm, figuring that an hour was enough lead time. I was wrong - the lines already stretched back and forth from the booth! It took around an hour to get to the front of the queue, but thankfully I was able to get two tickets for &lt;em&gt;Jersey Boys&lt;/em&gt; that evening at a 40% discount to the usual price. Many people were reaching the front and leaving disappointed that the shows they wanted were sold out, so I was very fortunate. Take this piece of advice from my experience: if you really want to see a particular show, you need to show up very early: earlier than an hour beforehand! You can see a live feed of available tickets and discounts that day at &lt;a href="http://www.tdf.org/TKTSBoards.aspx"&gt;http://www.tdf.org/TKTSBoards.aspx&lt;/a&gt; before you even arrive, so you know what's available that day, and availabilities are updated as tickets are sold, letting you know what's gone before you reach the front. With my tickets secure, all I had to do now was kill time until Camilla and I would meet at the theatre. I headed for the New York Public Library.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC00313.JPG"&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The Empire State Building through the window adjacent to the Rose Reading Room of the New York Public Library&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing that the US gets absolutely right is the public library system. Most cities feature a large, comfortable, well-stocked, and friendly public library, and they are perfect places to find a public toilet, acquire free wireless internet and/or power, and just relax for a little while. The New York Public Library has its primary branch in the Stephen A. Schwarzman Building on Fifth Avenue and 42nd Street. It is an enormous, majestic building just adjacent to Times Square and Bryant Park, and just a couple of blocks from Grand Central Terminal. It houses one of forty-eight surviving copies of the Gutenberg Bible - the first major booked printed with movable type in the West. Gutenberg Bibles are widely regarded as some of the most valuable books in the world today, and they are beautiful to behold. The Latin manuscript is rich, with each new paragraph gloriously accented and decorated in a kaleidoscope of inks. As a lifelong reader and book lover, I felt truly lucky to have seen it.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC00325.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With time rapidly dwindling, I had one more location to swing by before grabbing dinner. I wanted to see up close the world headquarters of the UN, which I had spotted from the Circle Line cruise a few days prior. Sadly, its aesthetics had not improved from earlier in the week, but the complex was impressive to behold up close. Located in the Turtle Bay district at the very eastern edge of 42nd Street, the squat General Assembly Building stands next to the tall tower of the Secretariat Building. I arrived after closing time, so I wasn't able to properly enter the complex and take a tour. Regretting this deeply, I decided that the next time I was in the city I would make sure to find time to explore the home of the world's greatest experiment in cross-country collaboration.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC00329.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Craving noodles, I found a small Japanese restaurant to wolf down a quick dinner. I then trekked to the August Wilson Theatre in the Broadway Theatre District - home to &lt;em&gt;Jersey Boys&lt;/em&gt; since 2005. I'm a bit of a sucker for musical theatre; I appreciate both the music (as a musician myself) and the showmanship of the performers. The West End in London and Broadway in New York are like a candy store to me: given unlimited funds and time, I would methodically work my way through everything on offer. &lt;em&gt;Jersey Boys&lt;/em&gt; is a jukebox musical that tells the story of Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons - the great American contemporaries to the Beatles with a catalogue of hits that are instantly recognisable to just about anyone (&lt;em&gt;Who Loves You&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;December 1963 (Oh What a Night), Can't Take My Eyes Off You, My Eyes Adored You, Sherry&lt;/em&gt;, the list goes on and on). Beyond the music and the success, the against the odds, rough-to-riches-to-tragedy story of the band is inspiring, and makes for great theatre. Camilla and I both thoroughly enjoyed the show.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC00338.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so my escapades in New York came to a close. The following morning I would leave behind the bright lights and towering skyscrapers from Penn Station, boarding an Amtrak that would bear me north, to Boston and the final leg of my East Coast adventure.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="New York"></category><category term="USA"></category><category term="Travel"></category></entry><entry><title>Travel tips for the United States</title><link href="http://dominickng.com/blog/2013/09/travel-tips-for-united-states/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2013-09-03T00:00:00+10:00</updated><author><name>Dominick Ng</name></author><id>tag:dominickng.com,2013-09-03:blog/2013/09/travel-tips-for-united-states/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've found myself giving lots of advice about travelling to the US to many people over the last few months, and I thought I should get around to writing down some of these. This post is a grab bag collection of tips for Australians looking to visit our neighbours across the Pacific. There's much to sort out when planning these trips, and I hope that this post helps cover some of the key issues.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Visas&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Australians travelling to the US for business or for a holiday of less than 90 days are eligible for the Visa Waiver Program. What this means is that to enter the US, you need to apply through ESTA: &lt;a href="https://esta.cbp.dhs.gov/esta/"&gt;Electronic System for Travel Authorization&lt;/a&gt;. This is an online application with a $14.00 fee that you need a credit card to pay for. You should apply for this at least a week or two before you leave just in case you fail the eligibility criteria (e.g. have you ever been rejected entry to the US? Or rejected for a US visa? You're not eligible for the waiver program) and need to go to the consulate for a proper visa. The turnaround time is usually less than a day if there's no problems, and your authorization lasts for two years at a time.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're going over to the US for longer than 90 days, you will need some other kind of visa - the H-1B working visa, the E-3 Australian working visa, the O- outstanding ability visa, or the J-1 or F-1 education/exchange visas. These visas almost certainly require you to fill out lengthy (online) applications, acquire a number of evidential documents, and provide proof of how you will support yourself in the US. They'll also require you to go to your nearest US consulate or embassy in person with your passport for an interview to complete the application. All up it can take weeks to complete the whole process (even getting an interview slot can take a while if your consulate is busy), so get started early. As a Fulbrighter, my J-1 visa application was smoothed by the Fulbright Commission and US State Department, and I still only received my visa about 10 days before I was due to fly out. It definitely pays to avoid that sort of stress.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Money&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wrote a lengthy post about travel money &lt;a href="http://blog.dominickng.com/2012/12/travel-money.html"&gt;a little while back&lt;/a&gt; recommending the &lt;a href="http://www.citibank.com.au/aus/banking/everyday_banking/citibank_plus.htm"&gt;Citibank Plus&lt;/a&gt; transaction account and the &lt;a href="http://www.28degreescard.com.au/"&gt;28 Degrees Mastercard&lt;/a&gt;. These two are a great combination for getting money from Australia to your overseas destination with a minimum of fees and exchange rate gouging. Of course, any credit card or debit credit card that you possess should still work overseas, but you will get slugged with international withdrawal fees, currency conversion fees, and a pretty ordinary exchange rate. I don't recommend prepaid travel cards or traveller's cheques either for the same reasons.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a good idea to let your credit card company know if you think you might need to use your card overseas - if you don't, there's a good chance the bank will block your card for suspected fraud if you try and use it in an exotic location. And of course, always take out some amount of cash before you go and have it with just in case - US dollars in particular are accepted almost everywhere in the global transit network. Avoid doing this at the airport to avoid the worst exchange rates.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Getting there&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several major airlines fly from Australia to the US. Of these, the only two really worth caring about are Virgin Australia and Qantas. They're substantially more comfortable than the US airlines - the extra expense is definitely worth it over a 14+ hour long flight. Plus, if you keep your eyes out for deals, you can often pick up flights very cheaply, e.g. well under $2000 return.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Entering the United States&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the United States! The first thing you'll do after disembarking is go through passport control at the airport, where Homeland Security forces will check if you're allowed in the country. If you're flying from Australia, chances are your US port of entry will be one of:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Los Angeles, California (LAX) &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dallas Fort-Wurth, Texas (DFW)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Honolulu, Hawaii (HNL)
Of these three, Honolulu is definitely the least crowded and chaotic. Both LAX and DFW are major US domestic and international hubs, and passport control can be a very slow, frustrating affair. On my first entry to the US at Dallas, I spent nearly two hours in the passport control hall - most of that waiting in a very slow moving queue. Our plane had arrived late, coinciding with other large incoming groups and giving everyone a bad day.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you finally reach the front of the line, expect the security officers to ask you a few questions about why you're coming to the US. They'll check that you've successfully applied for an ESTA or have a valid visa, and if everything is OK they will take your picture and your fingerprints and welcome you to the country. Congratulations!  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A side note on the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) - the group charged with US border security. There are many horror stories of the TSA breaking locks on bags, rummaging through luggage, and so forth. Over the course of nearly 20 flights in and around the US, I never had a problem with this, and never noticed anything amiss with my luggage once I got it back. You can actually buy approved locks (they have a little red logo on them) which the TSA have master keys for, so they don't need to break your existing locks to check your bag. I'm not sure if it's a big scam or not, but they're not that much more expensive, so why not.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Getting around&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The United States is enormous. Most big cities are &lt;em&gt;far&lt;/em&gt; apart from one another - far enough that you probably want to fly between them. That being said, the country features some of the most beautiful landscape in the world, and road trips (e.g. the Pacific Coast Highway 1 from San Francisco to Los Angeles) or long distance rail (on Amtrak) can be a great way to see some of these sights.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;US domestic air travel is serviceable, but unspectacular. I've flown on most of the US domestic airlines, and pretty much all of them rate about the same. Domestic flights typically use smaller, single-aisle planes (Boeing 737s or Airbus A320s) with less headroom and legroom than you might expect if you're used to flying international. However, online web check-in, mobile check-in, and smartphone tickets are pretty widely implemented, meaning that you need less paper than you used to. Non-US passengers will need a US ID or their passport to fly.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Domestic US flights rarely include a checked baggage allowance, meaning you have to pay fees if your bag is too big for the cabin. The main exception is if you're flying a codeshare flight originating from overseas or flying to overseas; your larger allowance from the international leg is generally carried over to the domestic leg as well. You can bring two pieces of cabin baggage with you: up to a 7kg bag, and a "personal item" that seems to scale up to a backpack. I usually took a backpack and a duffel (the &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Ogio-All-Terrain-Duffle-Bag/dp/B000NDM51Q/ref=sr_1_1?s=apparel&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1378260707&amp;amp;sr=1-1&amp;amp;keywords=ogio+all+terrain"&gt;Ogio All-Terrain Duffel&lt;/a&gt; was my bag of choice), and never had a problem with allowance. Sometimes I even had my small camera bag in addition to these two, and that was also never a problem.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the airlines stood out more from the others, for better or for worse:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alaska Airlines&lt;/strong&gt; is pretty cheap and they seem broadly competent. My return flight from Seattle to Oakland with them was severely delayed by some contractor accidentally severing a fiber optic cable connecting the airport to the data centre, which I guess wasn't their fault. The staff handled the situation very well, and passengers generally understood.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;American Airlines&lt;/strong&gt; are partners with Qantas, and I didn't like them very much. Nearly all of the AA flights I took were delayed, and not particularly comfortable. One positive thing was that on my way home to Australia, I had one severely overweight bag that I was expecting to pay a fortune for. However, they only charged me $50, which was a steal as the bag was nearly 10kg overweight. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Delta Airlines&lt;/strong&gt; isn't fantastic, and almost every Delta flight I took had some sort of issue, from &lt;a href="http://blog.dominickng.com/2013/04/east-coast-i-pitstop-in-detroit.html"&gt;forgotten refuelling&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="http://blog.dominickng.com/2013/05/east-coast-ii-washington-dc-day-1.html"&gt;fuel leaks&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately, Delta is hard to avoid as they have a very extensive network, and are partners with Virgin Australia.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hawaiian Airlines&lt;/strong&gt; is probably the nicest US carrier that I flew. They use roomy double-aisle A330s for their international leg, and relatively comfortable 767s on the domestic leg. They include some sort of free snack on their flights (a luxury!), and I enjoyed five free seats around me on my Sydney - Honolulu flight.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JetBlue Airlines&lt;/strong&gt; has a relatively small network, but they do give you one checked bag for free. They also seem to have fare sales all the time, judging from the constant email stream in my inbox. My one JetBlue flight was marred by malfunctioning toilets, which necessitated an unscheduled two hour stop in Salt Lake City on a flight from Boston to San Francisco.
Public transport in the US sucks in general. There are a few places (mainly on the east coast) where public transport is amazing, affordable, and all you need. But in general, it's not great, particularly when many incredible sightseeing spots like the national parks are far from urban areas. The easiest way to get around by far is driving. If you haven't yet worked it out, Americans drive on the right hand side of the road (opposite to Australia and the UK), but adapting is not too challenging. There are plenty of places to hire cars at reasonable rates to hit the road and see the sights.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tax and Tipping&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Practically speaking, these are two of the most irritating issues for visitors to the US from Australia.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost all prices are advertised &lt;em&gt;without sales tax&lt;/em&gt;. This is because sales tax is collected directly by each state, and is levied at a different rate and possibly on different goods and services in every state. What this means is that the price you see on the sticker on an item, or on a menu, or in advertising, or online, or anywhere &lt;em&gt;is almost never the price you pay&lt;/em&gt;. So don't bother trying to pull out exact change before you're told how much it will actually be. Some states have 0% sales tax (e.g. Delaware or Oregon), while other states have nearly 10% (California), so a good general rule is to add 10% to any price you see. At best, you'll be pleasantly surprised; but you'll never be rudely surprised.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On top of this, there is the much derided practice of tipping. Lower minimum wages for "tipping" jobs are actually encoded in US labour law, and the practice is deeply entrenched. I think this makes tipping an institution, meaning that its traditional role as a reward for good service is severely undermined. You're still expected to tip almost in spite of the quality of service you receive - not doing so is a very big social no-no, and you can only get away with it in fairly extreme circumstances.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, when in Rome, you do as the Romans do. You tip when &lt;em&gt;you have been provided with some sort of human service&lt;/em&gt;. For example, if you go buy lunch, and pay for it at the counter right away (e.g. at a fast food place, or in a food court), &lt;em&gt;you do not need to tip&lt;/em&gt;. In contrast, if you go to a restaurant and sit down to eat, &lt;em&gt;you do need to tip&lt;/em&gt; as you have been provided with table service. Along similar lines, you need to tip when:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;getting a haircut&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;getting a taxi ride&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;someone carries your bags in a hotel &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;buying drinks in a bar (usually $1 per drink; the more you tip, the stronger your drinks will be. I've experienced this personally)
The standard amount to tip (apart from in a bar) is &lt;em&gt;15%&lt;/em&gt;. Tip more if you're particularly pleased with the service, and maybe a little bit less (but no lower than 10%) if you're unhappy. A good rule of thumb is to allow an extra &lt;em&gt;25%&lt;/em&gt; on the price for tax and tip, depending on where you are and whether you need to tip or not. Those cheap looking prices aren't looking quite as good, are they! I found that living in San Francisco was about as pricey as living in Sydney.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summing Up&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope I've covered a broad swathe of questions pertinent to US travel. May your next trip stateside be fun, safe, and devoid of stress. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;script type= "text/javascript"&gt;

The tardiness of this post is regretted - July/August/September are always very busy months!  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My fourth day in New York was to be a walkabout day of exploring. I started by catching a subway north from Chelsea, back to the Columbia University area. Just near the university is the Grant National Memorial, which I had seen on the cruise the day before.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC00375.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the general of the Union forces, Ulysses S. Grant saw the surrender of the Confederate forces, the end of the American Civil War, and was then elected as 18th President of the United States. His government was marred by scandals and corruption, and he was left financially destitute after leaving office. He died in upstate New York of throat cancer just after completing his personal memoirs (the royalties from which went to his wife), and his tomb in Riverside Park is now the largest mausoleum in the United States. Grant and his wife Julia lie in large coffins inside, whilst a small museum dedicated to Grant's achievements as a general and President sits just near the building.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC00377.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Opposite Grant's tomb is the enormous Riverside Church. Interdenominational in nature, the church was funded by John D. Rockefeller, and features a distinctive Neo-Gothic architecture. While not as opulent within as St Peter's Basilica in Rome or the Il Duomo di Firenze in Florence, it remains one of the most impressive churches that I have visited.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC00384.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the church, I walked north east across several blocks towards the neighbourhood of Harlem. Well known as a major African-American district, Harlem is a sharp contrast to the skyscrapers of lower Manhattan. There is nary a building taller than four storeys; while gentrification of the area continues, many residents remain on income support, and there is a general run-down aura sweeping around the district.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC00389.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;125th Street is the primary drag through Harlem, and is a hub for arts and culture. Redevelopment and modernisation has seen global conglomerates move in next to quirky record stores and theatres. Its most famous landmark is the Apollo Theatre, near its western terminus. The Theatre is associated almost exclusively with African-American artists, and gained fame for launching the careers of such singers as Ella Fitzgerald, Billie Holiday, the Jacksons, Marvin Gaye, Stevie Wonder, and Aretha Franklin - just to name a few! It was also notable as for being the only theatre in New York that would hire black people for many years as the fight for civil rights dragged on around the country.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC00411.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I traversed Harlem from west to east, and then proceeded south along Lexington Avenue. The buildings gradually grew taller the further south I went, and before too long I cut back to the West to walk along the edge of Central Park. Before too long my legs were reminding me just how far I had walked, and I surrendered to them, taking a bus down to 5th Ave and Central Park South, where I strolled to the Hallo Berlin Food Stand on 54th Street for a delicious bratwurst lunch. There's almost always a queue because each order is made fresh, and the store's dictator/democracy themed specials are entertaining to read through and tasty to eat.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC00426.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My afternoon plan was to explore Central Park with my friends Camilla (from Australia) and Yoojin (from South Korea but studying at Berkeley). Camilla arrived first at the southeast corner of the Park, and while we waited for Yoojin to arrive we ducked into the nearby FAO Schwarz Toy Store, tucked behind the Apple Store on 5th Avenue. The store is an enormous, giddy testament to all things child-like. Hundreds of children were running around the store, dragging their frazzled parents behind them. One of the staff, a talented magician, was mesmerising a small crowd with an array of sleight-of-hand tricks. Of course, the highlight was the big piano - a $250,000 room-filling novelty with a large queue of people lining up for a 5 second go. If the line hadn't been so intimidatingly long and full of children we might have waited for a turn, but our waiting time was up, Yoojin had arrived, and it was time to enter the park.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC00468.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Central Park is truly enormous: its 340 hectares is enough that once you're deep enough inside, it's hard to tell you're in one of the busiest metropolises in the world. The noises of the city fade away as the park stretches on and on and on, with multiple waterways and weirs bisected by bridges carrying people, pets, and bikes through the green. There is a an enormous array of life and spectacle that takes place every single day in the park. We saw a number of bubble blowers and many fascinated children running after the huge billowing bubbles, popping them and coming back for more. People of all shapes and sizes, from all walks of life walk, jog, ride, drive, and amble through Central Park. It is wonderful watching the way a microcosm of human life interacts with the Park; highly recommended for the people watchers out there.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC00495.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A short shower saw us take refuge for a brief while at the boathouse restaurant. We couldn't find a catered seat there as many other people had the same idea, so we waited around under the roofs until the rain cleared. Yoojin took this opportunity to extract some electricity for her phone, and when the rain cleared we continued the stroll through the park. We came eventually to the Conservatory Water, where people were sailing model boats, and further along to the east edge we found this magnificent Alice in Wonderland statue. Cast in bronze, the statue was erected in the 1950's for children to come and experience the magic of Lewis Carroll's story; as such, the statue has many flat and smooth surfaces that just invite the beholder to climb and sit.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC00499.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moving out of the Park on its eastern edge, we took a delicious set of detours in the high-end shopping district of the Upper East Side. Our first stop was La Maison Du Chocolat, a luxury French chocolate store where we savoured delicious cakes, treats, and drinks. My cake was heaven in the mouth, whilst the chocolates that Camilla and Yoojin ordered looked delightful. I'll definitely make a trip back here the next time I'm in New York, and make sure to have more time to savour. Just a few blocks down the street is Laduree, a French bakery famous for its macaroons. We eagerly joined the queue that stretched out the door, awaiting our turn to be called upon by the staff to select our macaroons. My favourite were pistachio, coconut, and oddly enough, rose petal. Macaroons are a pricey extravagance, but they are such an oh so tasty one at that.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC00501.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yoojin had to depart following our Laduree trip, so we sadly bid her goodbye. Camilla and I trekked back across Central Park to the Upper West side and Levain Bakery. Unassumingly buried below street level, Levain is featured in many foodies' guides to New York, and is famous for a six-ounce chocolate chip walnut cookie. The proprietors developed the monster cookie to help provide calories for ironman training events, and it is now the signature item on their menu. Feeling obligated, I bought one of the cookies, and it is hands down the best cookie I've ever eaten. I don't think I could manage one very often unless I actually turned to competing in ironman events, but resisting the temptation would be a sore challenge.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC00503.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By now it was quite late, and so Camilla and I made our way to Koreatown near the foot of the Empire State Building for dinner. One of the things that is so incredible about New York is how it really is a reflection of the world at large; the main 34th Street drag of Koreatown felt like it could have come straight out of East Asia. We enjoyed some tasty bibimbap and noodles for dinner at a busy food court before parting ways after a solid afternoon of exploring. In this one day I had covered a great swathe of the north side of Manhattan as well as the sprawling Central Park: now, I had just one more day to spend in the city that never sleeps. &lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Travel"></category><category term="New York"></category><category term="USA"></category></entry><entry><title>Closing the doors on the lucky country</title><link href="http://dominickng.com/blog/2013/07/closing-doors-on-lucky-country/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2013-07-21T00:00:00+10:00</updated><author><name>Dominick Ng</name></author><id>tag:dominickng.com,2013-07-21:blog/2013/07/closing-doors-on-lucky-country/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I am a first-generation Australian. My parents arrived in this country nearly forty years ago, seeking better opportunities for the future. I was born in a small country town in regional New South Wales, and I had the great fortune to grow up in a safe, welcoming environment, free from many of the anxieties and insecurities that plague much of the Western World as well as the terrifying dangers and tensions rife in many developing countries. I am very lucky to be where I am today, and much of that has come from where and when I was born. My parents have worked tirelessly each and every single day since they arrived to create the best possible environment for me and my younger brother and sister. They started from nothing and with nothing.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have had the privilege of attending prestigious universities, living in one of the world's most naturally beautiful cities, and meeting and working with incredible people from all around the world. Australia is a highly advanced, politically stable, secure, prosperous, and blessed country - and we are far luckier for it than billions around the world. I love living here, and after a year spent in the United States and countless travels across Asia and Europe, I can't imagine wanting to settle any where else.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/byboatnovisa.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Image from &lt;http://www.immi.gov.au/visas/humanitarian/novisa/&gt; \- 21st July 2013&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's taken me a few days to figure out exactly what chills me about the Australian Government's &lt;a href="http://www.immi.gov.au/visas/humanitarian/novisa/"&gt;new immigration policy&lt;/a&gt;, where asylum seekers arriving on boats without visas will be unilaterally barred from our shores. It's deeper than dismay at the lurch to the right, the disgustingly insular rhetoric printed in the media, or the scathingly predictable three-word slogans emanating from the politicians. I felt that something else, something more important was wrong. And what it boils down to is this.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will people like me be welcome in Australia in the years to come?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are a country of immigrants. Every single one of us, European, American, Asian, African, Middle-Eastern, Latino or Pacific Islander. In fact, I'd wager that a huge proportion of the population has some ancestor who arrived here on a boat and probably without a visa. Yet, year by year, we seem to be growing increasingly hostile to those who've come across the sea to share in our boundless plains. Now, I have experienced racism; seen the ugly scrawls of GO HOME on the windows of my parent's shop and endured the judgmental banalities of the misinformed. I have seen the effects of this on those I care about. I had thought that these were the bad eggs at the fringes of our society - the natural result of growing up as a token minority in an overwhelming Anglo-Saxon community. The vast majority of the people I know share my views. But the immigration policies of our two mainstream political parties suggests that I must have a very narrow circle indeed.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, any asylum seeker who comes to Australia by boat without a visa will be forcibly resettled in Papua New Guinea, a country with myriad social, political, and economic troubles. It is more extreme than any immigration policy we have had since the dissolution of the White Australia Policy some 40 years ago. The very notion that one must be pre-approved and issued credentials to seek asylum is laughable considering the circumstances that drive most to seek asylum in the first place. The very notion that it is possible to "stop the boats", to stop people from escaping horrifying situations is laughable. The very notion that the greatest threat to this country is incoming boat arrivals is laughable. But what isn't laughable is what these attitudes say about us as a people, and for that I am deeply ashamed.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Xenophobia is rising across the world, and that is truly saddening. It's pushing governments to undertake ever more draconian measures in the name of satisfying the people. The fear of the different, the exotic, the not-the-same is really what hurts. Countries teeter on the edge of civil and international wars brought on by deep-set prejudices - and in response those countries further embrace those prejudices. It is a circuit that has no end - one that we as a world has pledged time and time again to step away from.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given different circumstances, it could easily be me on one of those boats, floating towards an uncertain tomorrow but away from a catastrophic today. It could be an innumerable number of my friends, most of whom are also recent-generation Australians. Is this what the majority of Australians think of people like us? Is this sense of entitlement - to a country forcibly wrested from its original inhabitants no less - is this the new norm for our society?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are an embarrassingly fortunate people. And in a world where such fortune is rare, it is our responsibility to do our part to help those without such luck. It is not illegal to seek asylum in Australia. It should be illegal for us to turn away from helping those in need.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Australia"></category><category term="Politics"></category></entry><entry><title>East Coast (VI): New York, Part 3</title><link href="http://dominickng.com/blog/2013/06/east-coast-vi-new-york-part-3/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2013-06-18T00:00:00+10:00</updated><author><name>Dominick Ng</name></author><id>tag:dominickng.com,2013-06-18:blog/2013/06/east-coast-vi-new-york-part-3/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This is the sixth in a series of posts about my East Coast US trip in March 2013 (see the &lt;a href="http://blog.dominickng.com/2013/04/east-coast-i-pitstop-in-detroit.html"&gt;first part&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://blog.dominickng.com/2013/05/east-coast-ii-washington-dc-day-1.html"&gt;second part&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://blog.dominickng.com/2013/05/east-coast-iii-washington-dc-day-2.html"&gt;third part&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://blog.dominickng.com/2013/05/east-coast-iv-new-york-part-1.html"&gt;fourth part&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://blog.dominickng.com/2013/06/east-coast-v-new-york-part-2.html"&gt;fifth part&lt;/a&gt;).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My third day in New York started off very sunny, and I had planned to take the Staten Island ferry (which is free!) on a round trip to get photos of the Statue of Liberty. Sadly, Liberty Island itself was still closed due to the damage caused by Hurricane Sandy in October 2012, so I wouldn't be able to see the famous Statue from any closer. My plans changed however when my lovely host Dee convinced me to take the Circle Line ferry tour of Manhattan Island - a 3 hour boat ride complete with commentary that encircled the entire island. I'm very glad that she convinced me to take this ferry tour; it's very cheap, terrifically informative, and a great way of seeing the scope of Manhattan.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC09853.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Circle Line ferry departs from Pier 83, just near West 42nd Street and 12th Avenue. You have to pick up your ticket at the pier (booking online gives you a printable voucher that can be exchanged for a ticket up to a year in the future); I arrived about 30 minutes before the first departure of the day, but ended up getting a ticket for the later 3pm departure since the lines move very slowly. Now with 3 hours to kill, I searched around for other entertainment, thankfully finding some just next door at Pier 86 (West 46th Street and 12th Avenue), home of the aircraft carrier &lt;em&gt;Intrepid&lt;/em&gt;. Dating back to World War II and the Pacific war against Japan, &lt;em&gt;Intrepid&lt;/em&gt; served with distinction in the United States Navy before being retired and turned into a floating air and space museum. Perched jauntily on its upper deck is the space shuttle &lt;em&gt;Enterprise&lt;/em&gt;. The first shuttle ever built, the &lt;em&gt;Enterprise&lt;/em&gt; was used to test the aerodynamic performance of the orbiter design, and it never actually made it into space. Sadly, the shuttle exhibit was another victim of the battering poured on the city from Hurricane Sandy; its tail fin was damaged, and it remains off-limits to the public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC09875.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Pier 86 itself, right next to the &lt;em&gt;Intrepid&lt;/em&gt;, sits a &lt;em&gt;Concorde&lt;/em&gt;. Formerly the world's fastest passenger jet, the &lt;em&gt;Concorde _flew an express Atlantic service in half the time of ordinary jets, but it struggled for profitability, and the planes were retired in 2003. The plane's distinctive swept-back wings (necessary since it flies faster than the speed of sound!) and pointed nose (this actually has a mechanism to drop down for takeoff and landing to give the pilot a less obstructed view) give it an aesthetic unmatched by any other commercial jet; it's simply striking to look at. There is free entry to the pier (though to enter you still need to go through the _Intrepid&lt;/em&gt; museum ticket line and request a pier entry ticket), so you can actually walk right up to the &lt;em&gt;Concorde&lt;/em&gt; without paying. Entering the plane and seeing inside requires a special ticket on top of the regular museum entry fee, and since the space shuttle was off limits, I didn't feel like it would be worth it. But as a sucker for things that fly, just being able to walk around the plane and see it up close was enough for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC09899.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still had a substantial amount of time to kill, so I hopped on the subway north to check out Columbia University in Morningside Heights, up on the north west edge of Manhattan Island. One of the prestigious Ivy League private universities, the Columbia campus is a welcome departure from the steel skyscrapers of Midtown. The buildings are neoclassical in style, and I found the Butler Library (above) particularly striking. I ambled through the Low Library (now the administrative centre for the university), found the computer science building, and grabbed some sushi for lunch in one of the student cafes. The campus is enormous, and all of this quickly consumed the couple of hours I had to spare before the cruise. My time thus exhausted, I headed back south to Pier 83 for the ferry ride.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC09916.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Circle Line ferries are large, with two levels, inside and outside seating, and cafe amenities for refreshments along the way. Upon departing from Pier 83, the ferry proceeds south down the Hudson River, circling Manhattan Island in a counter-clockwise direction. One of the staff members provides a narration of the passing slights along the way, sharing vast amounts of interesting tidbits about the sights of New York City. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC09968.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the undisputed highlights of the trip was the Statue of Liberty, originally gifted to the US by the people of France. The statue stands on Liberty Island just off the south coast of Manhattan, and represents Libertas, the Roman goddess of freedom. The tablet in her hand bears the date of the American Declaration of Independence, and the statue itself is renowned as a symbol of welcome to immigrants arriving in the United States. It's quite thrilling seeing her up close, particularly as a temporary visitor to these shores. Whilst clouds came and went over the course of our ferry ride, the sun won out as we passed Lady Liberty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC09988.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rounding past Liberty Island and around the south edge of Manhattan, we got a fantastic view of Battery Park (the clump of trees on the shore) and the skyscrapers of the Financial District. The tallest skyscraper is the Freedom Tower at One World Trade Center, which was still under construction at the time and missing its crowning spire. The sight of these proud buildings gleaming in the sun was simply amazing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC00013.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ferry proceeded north up the East River, which separates Manhattan from the borough of Brooklyn. Brooklyn is the most populous of New York's boroughs; if it were a city upon itself, its 2.5 million people would make it the third most populous in the United States after Los Angeles and Chicago. Here we began to pass the first of many bridges connecting Manhattan to the mainland. There are a multitude of bridges and tunnels criss-crossing the rivers, carrying vehicle traffic, subways, heavy rail, pedestrians, pipes, power, and more, with each new construction often breaking records set by the previous one. We sailed underneath the iconic Brooklyn Bridge, which I had walked partway across the previous day. Our guide told us a useful mnemonic for remembering the bridges between Manhattan and Brooklyn: (B)rooklyn, (M)anhattan, and (W)illiamsburg from south to north.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC00047.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we continued north, we found ourselves with a pristine view of the famous Chrysler Building. I don't know what it is about the city of New York, but there are so many buildings here that one can see and instantly recognise. Today Chrysler is by no means the largest skyscraper in the city, but to see it is to immediately realise what it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC00053.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further north up the East River is the headquarters of the United Nations. The entire complex is technically not part of New York; treaty arrangements recognise the site as under the jurisdiction of the UN, though the city still provides it with essential services. The ugly looking concrete eyesore in the photo above is actually the building that houses the United Nations General Assembly - the primary deliberative organisation of the group. I found it strange that such a titular building in the world's primary forum for international relations could be so unpleasant to look at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC00054.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brooklyn eventually gives way to the borough of Queens, home of New York's two major airports (LaGuardia to the north, and JFK to the south). At 2.2 million people, it's just a little smaller than Brooklyn, and would be the fourth most populous in the US as an independent city. On its western edge is the Gantry Plaza State Park, perched on the waterfront at Long Island City. A former Pepsi bottling plant, the area has been reclaimed as public land, and all that remains of the bottling operation is the preserved sign, now a centrepiece of the park and yet another iconic symbol of the city. It's visible from the Empire State Building, and has been featured in many films set in the city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC00059.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many small islands in the New York Bay area along the East and Harlem Rivers. One of them is Roosevelt Island, named for Franklin Roosevelt. It's long and skinny at 3 kilometres by 240 metres across at its widest point. Just 10,000 people live on the island; in years gone by it was the site of a penitentiary, a long-term care hospital, and a lighthouse. The 59th Street Bridge (recently and controversially renamed the Ed Koch Queensboro Bridge after a former Mayor of the city) passes directly over the island in connecting Manhattan and Queens, and alongside the bridge runs the Roosevelt Island Tramway - an elevated trolley line that carries passengers from Manhattan to the island. For some reason, I found the concept of a quaint elevated tramway in New York, the shining example of mass public transport in the United States, to be unreasonably amusing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC00067.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Near the junction between the Harlem and East Rivers is the Triborough Bridge (grey-green in the foreground above), which connects the three boroughs of Manhattan, Queens, and the Bronx over three island-hopping spans. In the background is the Hell Gate Bridge, named after the section of the East River that it crosses. Painted in now-faded "hell red", the bridge was the original inspiration for the Sydney Harbour Bridge, and I for one am very pleased that the arch design won out over the alternative cantilever design. If the Hell Gate Bridge looks a bit squashy in the picture above, it's because our bridge in Sydney is half again as big - the red one spans just 310 metres, whilst Sydney Harbour Bridge spans 504 metres.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC00078.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we turned north west up the Harlem River, the borough of the Bronx came into view. Directly north of Manhattan, the Bronx is the only borough of New York that is actually located on the mainland US; the four other boroughs are all on islands. Perhaps the most famous icon we passed was Yankee Stadium, home to the eponymous New York baseball team. Opened in 2009, the stadium cost a controversial $1.5 billion, and replaced the older Yankee Stadium that became an American icon from its opening in 1923.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC00082.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not all of New York's bridges carry traffic. The High Bridge over the Harlem River between The Bronx and Manhattan operated as an aqueduct, carrying water from the Croton River to the northeast into Manhattan. The engineering required to construct the aqueduct system is astounding; it was built in the mid 1800's at a time when New York was ravaged by diseases caused by poor sanitation. The aqueduct was purely powered by gravity; stretching for over 50km, it sloped downwards about 20 centimetres per kilometre, slowly drawing the water to the receiving reservoir on Manhattan Island. Today, the High Bridge no longer carries water, and newer aqueducts and tunnels have superseded the Old Croton system. Currently under refurbishment, the bridge will reopen to pedestrian traffic in 2014.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC00089.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having rounded the north end of the island (passing by the Sputyen Duyvil rail swing bridge on the way), the boat turned south on the Hudson River to complete our circle of Manhattan. Along the way we passed the George Washington Bridge. This is a behemoth of a bridge; its double decks carry 14 lanes of traffic in total, and it reportedly has the highest vehicular capacity of any bridge in the world. When it opened in 1931, the GW had the longest span of any suspension bridge in the world until the 1937 opening of the Golden Gate Bridge.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC00093.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the board passed Morningside Heights and the area of the Columbia University campus, we passed two more notable landmarks on the upper west side. On the left above is the tomb of Ulysses S. Grant, commanding general of the Union forces in the American Civil War, and 18th President of the United States. On the right is the enormous Riverside Church. Having spotted them, I resolved to visit them proper before I left the city (and I'll talk about that visit in the next post).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC00095.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many rooftops in New York are dotted with large water tanks holding tens of thousands of litres - there are over a dozen in the photo above. These water towers are necessary to supply water pressure to the upper floors of a building; pumping the water solely from the ground requires much higher pressures that can burst pipes. The water is also used for firefighting purposes; indeed, as New York grew upwards in the 19th century, buildings taller than six stories were legally required to have a water tower, partially for the water supply, but also to assuage fears regarding safety in case of flames. The tanks look like a relic from another era - many are constructed of unpainted wood as paint taints the water supply, and steel is substantially more expensive. In recent times, residents have been finding more inventive uses for the tanks - some of them have been repurposed for hidden (illegal) nightclubs and bars, accessible only by those in the know or possessed of a special invitation. &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/23/nyregion/illicit-nightclub-in-a-chelsea-water-tower.html"&gt;I'm not kidding&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC00101.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found this curious row of tall buildings just past Morningside Heights, and right before the row of piers that marked the end of our ferry ride. I don't actually know what they are, but I found something of their composition amusing. Minutes after I took this shot, we sailed past the &lt;em&gt;Intrepid&lt;/em&gt; and back into Pier 83, bringing the cruise to an end. It was a truly worthwhile way to see the whole of Manhattan, as well as gain a bit of the history of the city, its bridges, and its sights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That evening, I headed to the Alphabet City (so named because it is east of 1st Avenue, so the streets are Avenue A, Avenue B, etc.) for dinner with some old friends from Sydney. I had met Courtney and Camilla many years ago when we worked as student ambassadors for the University of Sydney, and now Courtney was living in New York, while Camilla was spending a few months in the city prior to starting work. We ate at a pasta restaurant named Paprika, on St Marks Place, and both the food and the company were wonderful. It's an amazing thing to be able to reunite with old friends halfway around the world in a city as large and exciting as New York. I headed home in a very cheerful frame of mind, looking forward to more exploring the next day. &lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="New York"></category><category term="USA"></category><category term="Travel"></category></entry><entry><title>East Coast (V): New York, Part 2</title><link href="http://dominickng.com/blog/2013/06/east-coast-v-new-york-part-2/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2013-06-02T00:00:00+10:00</updated><author><name>Dominick Ng</name></author><id>tag:dominickng.com,2013-06-02:blog/2013/06/east-coast-v-new-york-part-2/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This is the fifth in a series of posts about my East Coast US trip in March 2013 (see the &lt;a href="http://blog.dominickng.com/2013/04/east-coast-i-pitstop-in-detroit.html"&gt;first part&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://blog.dominickng.com/2013/05/east-coast-ii-washington-dc-day-1.html"&gt;second part&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://blog.dominickng.com/2013/05/east-coast-iii-washington-dc-day-2.html"&gt;third part&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://blog.dominickng.com/2013/05/east-coast-iv-new-york-part-1.html"&gt;fourth part&lt;/a&gt;).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC09577.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rain mostly stayed away during my second day in New York, and I took advantage of the respite to go walkabout on Manhattan Island. My morning started with a particularly New-York style breakfast of a savoury bagel. I then walked to the east, towards the Flatiron district and its eponymous Flatiron building. The distinctively triangular building resembles a clothes iron (hence the name), and its shape is due in part to its position on the wedge-shaped intersection of Broadway, 5th Avenue, and East 22nd Street.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC09592.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Flatiron I jumped on the subway, heading south to Town Hall near the southern end of Manhattan. Here I wandered around to the east of the island towards the famous Brooklyn Bridge. One of three bridges connecting Manhattan to the borough of Brooklyn in the east, it was opened in 1883, and remains one of the oldest suspension bridges in the United States. I strolled along the bridge far enough to take a photo unhindered by construction before turning back towards Manhattan.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC09608.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The south end of Manhattan is the home of the financial district and Wall Street. It is also here that the World Trade Center towers once stood before the 9/11 attacks. Today, the Ground Zero memorial stands at the site to memorialise those who lost their lives in 2001. Entry is free, but requires an online registration prior to visiting, so I did not get to entry the memorial proper. Additionally, crowds are extremely large; it can take over an hour to make it from the back of the line into the memorial. Obnoxiously enough, the construction of the new Freedom Tower at the north end of the World Trade Center complex means that the entire area is walled off, so you can't even see inside. I spent some time walking around the site before moving on.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC09625.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wall Street is a quaintly cobblestone boulevard running west from the World Trade Center. One of the first buildings you see is the venerable New York Stock Exchange - and I managed to capture a humourous moment with a paper-shredding truck sitting just down the laneway from the Exchange's entrance.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;&lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC09633.jpg"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Opposite the NYSE is Federal Hall National Memorial. The original Federal Hall was New York's first City Hall, and famously served as the site of George Washington's inauguration as the first President of the United States. It was also the site of the introduction of the Bill of Rights (the first ten amendments to the US Constitution) in the First Congress. After the Hall's demolition in 1812, the Memorial Hall was built in 1842, and it is now operated as a museum commemorating the historic events of its past. Out the front is a large statue of George Washington. When I visited, there was a ragged man huddled underneath the statue, playing on flute the most solemn version of _The Star-Spangled Banner _that I have ever heard (this is the national anthem of the United States, and is typically played with great pomp and circumstance at sporting events). The poignancy I felt is difficult to understate; seeing this quiet protest on Wall Street surrounded by the very individuals blamed for plunging America into the most devastating recession of recent history moved me deeply.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC09646.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By now it had reached lunchtime, and I trekked back to the west side of Manhattan to meet with my friend David. I met him many years ago in Sydney, and nowadays he works for Google in New York. The company's office is in the former Port Authority building, located between 8th and 9th Avenues and West 15th and 16th Streets. Even by Google standards it is an amazing office, and it would be a wonder to work there day in and day out. The office is rectangular and long, much like Manhattan, and so internally corridors and meeting rooms are named as per locations on Manhattan Island to ease navigation. It's a little like Google has reconstructed the big city inside its own fiefdom.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/IMG_0741.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google owns the entire Port Authority building, and one of the employee perks is having access to the roof. Comfy seats are arranged around the floor for people to use and enjoy. There are truly spectacular views from here all around the city thanks to the building's location in a relatively skyscraper-free zone.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC09660.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Departing Google, I wandered through the nearby Chelsea Market and onto the High Line. It's an elevated park built on a formerly abandoned section of the New York Central Railroad, and it reminded me of the Promenade Plantee in Paris, which was built to a similar concept. There are staircase entrances to the High Line all along its length, as well all kinds of interesting urban art installations. It's a popular spot for tourists and families; buskers ply their wares for people who've stopped for a break or a view, people set up picnics and photographs, and enjoy the ambience of a little nature in the busy city. There's also the cute novelty of strolling down grass-lined paths up above the busy New York streets.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC09676.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walking along the High Line gives you a great sense of the space constraints faced by New York City. The buildings that the Line squeezes past are so close that you can peer into the often tiny apartments on either side. The Line even passes through some buildings, providing natural shelter and shade. There is nary a gap between two structures all along the way, and many of the artworks are plastered on the sides of buildings, or in gaps caused by their shapes. The original rail lines still run along the park in many places, serving as a reminder of the service that the Line once performed for the city.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC09683.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coming off the High Line at West 30th Street, I walked back east towards the centre of Manhattan. I had a little time to kill before a scheduled visit to Top of the Rock, so I walked to 7th Avenue, then north to the southeast corner of the enormous Central Park. This is the site of the famous Apple store cube, and I stopped to take a quick photo for my brother, who is a massive Mac fan. The store is amazingly crowded; it's open 24 hours, and descending the spiral glass staircase takes you into a packed and noisy interior under the street level.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC09695.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walking back south, I headed for the GE Building at Rockefeller Center. Nestled in the heart of Midtown, the Center was built by the famous Rockefeller family, who were one of the most powerful dynasties in the history of the United States. The GE Building itself is also known as 30 Rock for its address at 30 Rockefeller Plaza, and it is the home of the NBC television network and NBC studios. On the ground floor there's a great NBC store carrying merchandise from all of the network's most popular series, as well as the NBC studio experience tour. But the real reason I came here was Top of the Rock: the observation deck on the top of the building. It's cheaper and less crowded than the Empire State Building observation deck, and has the added bonus of having a view of the Empire State Building.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC09721.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The view certainly does not disappoint, though the wind is icy cold up here so come prepared with gloves if you can. You get a great, clean view of the entire Empire State Building, and panoramic views of the rest of the city. I spent a long time happily snapping away; the rest of Midtown and the distant Freedom Tower dominate the south view (with the Chrysler Building just hiding behind another skyscraper), whilst Central Park rules over the north view. Seeing it from the air really brings the enormity of Central Park into perspective: the steel simply gives way to a huge expanse of green right in the heart of Manhattan Island. If you're pressed for time and patience in New York (and almost no one isn't), then I highly recommend skipping the Empire State Building and visiting Top of the Rock instead.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC09747.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having satisfied my inner photographer, I descended back to street level and headed further east and to the famous Grand Central Terminal. Possibly the most famous train station in the world, the famous Main Concourse is forever bustling and busy. An Apple store is seemingly carved into the stone wall at one end of the concourse, whilst down on the ground people scurry to and fro. There's a huge American flag on one wall, raised in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks and remaining there to this day. Deeper underground is an extensive retail and food complex, as well as the subway station and the actual train platforms - 44 of them in total, with 67 different tracks. Grand Central now primarily handles traffic on the domestic lines that run within New York state; the Amtrak interstate lines depart from Pennsylvania Station to the west. However, Grand Central is much more beautiful than Penn Station; Penn is currently shrouded under construction scaffolding, and has nothing of the 19th century charm and grace of Grand Central. Simply put, it is the train station.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC09827.JPG"&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;This was taken with a longer exposure to capture the ghostly impression of busy movement&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leaving Grand Central behind, I continued only a little further west before calling my day to a close. I made it to the Chrysler Building, widely regarded as one of the most beautiful Art Deco skyscrapers in the country. It was built at the same time as the Empire State Building, during a time of strong competition for the tallest skyscraper in the world. Chrysler was finished a year ahead of Empire State, and so held the crown as the tallest building in the world for 11 months. Nowadays the building is far smaller than several of its neighbours, but I think it remains one of the most elegant. It is particularly famous for the terraced crown and spire at its peak; at night time, it is perhaps one of the most iconic features of the New York skyline.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC09846.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so my second day in New York came to a close. I found myself some dinner in Chinatown before heading back to Chelsea for a well-earned night's sleep. There would be three more days of exploring to come.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="New York"></category><category term="Travel"></category><category term="USA"></category></entry><entry><title>East Coast (IV): New York, Part 1</title><link href="http://dominickng.com/blog/2013/05/east-coast-iv-new-york-part-1/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2013-05-18T00:00:00+10:00</updated><author><name>Dominick Ng</name></author><id>tag:dominickng.com,2013-05-18:blog/2013/05/east-coast-iv-new-york-part-1/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This is the fourth in a series of posts about my East Coast US trip in March 2013 (see the &lt;a href="http://blog.dominickng.com/2013/04/east-coast-i-pitstop-in-detroit.html"&gt;first part&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://blog.dominickng.com/2013/05/east-coast-ii-washington-dc-day-1.html"&gt;second part&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://blog.dominickng.com/2013/05/east-coast-iii-washington-dc-day-2.html"&gt;third part&lt;/a&gt;).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was snowing in Washington DC as Tara and I departed - she to the airport, and me to Union Station. Our time there had seen the weather go from brilliant sunshine to dull overcast to snow, and in the ten minutes it took me to reach the train station I was coated in crisp white. I had a 6:15AM bus to catch that would take me to the big city: New York. The northeast corner of the US features several large cities clustered close together, and services such as the Chinatown Bus, Bolt Bus, and Megabus offer fast and cheap service between the cities. Often the buses have wifi, and pickup and depart from the city centre rather than a distant airport. My Megabus ticket cost $14 for the 4 hour trip between Washington DC and New York, and while we were slightly delayed due to the snow, the trip was smooth and uneventful.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC09722.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New York is one of the most storied cities in the United States. At over eight million people, it is the most populous in the country, and it is a leading cultural, financial, commercial, and technological centre. It remains the gateway to America for many immigrants and tourists. The centrepiece is undoubtedly Manhattan Island, where over 1.5 million people live and numerous landmarks abound. I spent all my time in New York on Manhattan, but there are four more boroughs of the city that I did not visit: The Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens, and Staten Island. They'll have to wait for next time.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York is also one of the most expensive cities to visit in the world. Leery of the high hostel and hotel prices, I decided to try Airbnb for accommodation in New York, and found it to be a generally pleasant experience. Airbnb is a service where people can rent out spare rooms couches, or even their whole house on a short-term, informal manner. The company takes a somewhat obnoxious 4% service fee, but provides a great website for listing and looking up places, as well as facilities such as property insurance and validated contact information. It does take a little effort to find a decent place to stay (the usual combination of checking reviews, location, pictures, etc. applies here) - I had to send out several inquiries before I found someone who actually had an availability for the days I wanted. Eventually, I ended up staying with Dee in the Chelsea district, close to many of the major subway lines. I saved close to 50% compared to the cheapest hotel I could find (and could have saved more had my standards been lower), and Dee was a wonderful hostess.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC09510.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Manhattan's streets are almost entirely named and laid out on a numbered grid system; avenues run north-south, and streets run east-west. Streets are often prefixed with an east or west label to further identify the location of particular places (e.g. 160 West 16th Street). This combined with the world-renowned subway system makes the city easy to navigate. Trains run 24 hours a day throughout the city - as close as 2 minutes apart during busy periods, and closer to 10-15 minutes apart during quieter hours. The few locations that are inconvenient for the subway (the West Side and around Central Park) are well-served by buses conveniently numbered by the main street or avenue that they traverse. The system notation is slightly confusing, mixing colours and identifiers, but the gist is that the alphanumeric identifiers refer to different services (e.g. express or all-stops/local) that run on a common line (the colour). Ticketing is also relatively simple; for my 5 day stay I purchased a 7-day MetroCard that offered unlimited rides on the subway and buses for $30. It was an absolute bargain as single trips usually cost $2.75. I caught the subway multiple times a day, criss-crossing the island to catch as many sights as I could.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC09484.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent most of my first day in New York City catching up with my friend Tian. Fitful rain spattered down on us this first day and night, though it thankfully disappeared by the next morning. We met up near Madison Square Garden on 7th Ave and 34th Street, and then walked all the way to 1st Ave and 11th Street to the world-famous &lt;a href="http://momofuku.com/new-york/noodle-bar/"&gt;Momofuku Noodle Bar&lt;/a&gt; for a delicious ramen lunch, passing Washington Square Park. Then we ambled to a nearby subway stop to head back up to Midtown to the Museum of Modern Art - better known as MoMA. Possibly my favourite art gallery so far, MoMA holds many Western masterpieces, including Edvard Munch's &lt;em&gt;The Scream&lt;/em&gt; (above; on temporary loan to the museum), Vincent van Gogh's &lt;em&gt;The Starry Night&lt;/em&gt; (below), and the 12.5m wide &lt;em&gt;Reflections of Clouds on the Water-Lily Pond&lt;/em&gt; by Claude Monet. I'm a big fan of Impressionist art (though Impressionist music bores me to tears), with their thick, mottled brushstrokes and natural imagery. Unlike many other modern art museums, MoMA holds a huge collection of these works alongside more contemporary pieces. It's huge but easy to take in at the same time - the exhibits are fascinating and full of fun for people of any age. The gift store is also fantastic, with all manner of crazy knick-knacks perfect for souvenirs. I highly, highly, highly recommend a trip to MoMA if you can fit it in - though pre-buying a ticket might be advisable due to its popularity.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC09487.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By now evening had fallen in New York, and so we headed along West 32nd Street to Koreatown for dinner. As its name suggests, Koreatown is like a mini Seoul, a street filled to the brim with restaurants, karaoke places, and neon lights.  The famous Empire State Building sits on West 34th Street, so you can get a great view of it looking upwards from here (see below). We were looking for a Sichuan Hot Pot place for a fiery dinner, but instead found a tasty Japanese variant called Shabu-Shabu. The basic concept is that you have a burner in front of your place at the table, and a bowl of broth is placed there to boil. You then receive various raw ingredients that you cook in the broth as it boils. It's absolutely delicious and very fresh.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC09503.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following dinner, Tian went to a Sigur Ros concert at Madison Square Garden near Penn Station, whilst I went back to the apartment where I was staying to unwind a bit. We met up again after the concert finished to walk up to Times Square, the "Crossroads of the World". The Square sits on the junction of 7th Avenue, Broadway, and 42nd Street, and is brightly lit in neon colours - even in the early hours of the morning. Named after the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; newspaper moved its headquarters to the building that is now One Times Square (site of the New Year's ball drop), the Square is simply surreal. No place should be as bright as this in the black of night. Crazy lights blast at you from all angles - mainly advertising billboards on the tall buildings that surround the Square.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC09536.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Times Square was under substantial construction when we were there. Several roads were partially or fully blocked, with pedestrian access also slightly restricted. Given the late-ness of the hour and the time of the year, it was &lt;em&gt;freezing&lt;/em&gt; cold. We wandered into a 24-hour Starbucks for some sustenance and fortification against the cold before braving the benches in the middle of the Square. I can't imagine how frigid it would be to wait for New Year's here. Definitely a once - maybe only once - in a lifetime experience.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC09529.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Times Square is the hub of New York's famous theatre district, better known as Broadway after the main boulevard through the district. Broadway extends west and north of Times Square, block after block after block jam packed with theatres and show halls. Much of the Square's bright advertising is for the latest Broadway shows; when we visited, the hottest tickets were for &lt;em&gt;Book of Mormon&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Matilda&lt;/em&gt; (an adaptation of Roald Dahl's classic book), as well as perennial classics such as &lt;em&gt;Phantom of the Opera&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Jersey Boys&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Chicago&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Mamma Mia&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Wicked&lt;/em&gt;. The biggest theatres hold hundreds to thousands of people., but there are also a host of smaller, more intimate theatres in the district that show smaller musicals, plays and shows - collectively known as Off-Broadway. It's Off-Broadway where many shows are first tried, tweaked, and tested before a launch on Broadway proper (e.g. the classic musical &lt;em&gt;Rent&lt;/em&gt;). Alternatively, shows that have finished their Broadway run, or have begun losing momentum on Broadway may be relaunched in a small location in a cheaper, less extravagant form (e.g. &lt;em&gt;Avenue Q&lt;/em&gt;).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC09530.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the north of the Square, underneath a giant red staircase, is the TKTS discount tickets booth. Same-day excess tickets for Broadway and Off-Broadway shows are sold here on a first-come, first-served basis, with availability changing each day. The booth opens at 3pm in the afternoon to sell tickets for the evening shows, and the lines are &lt;em&gt;enormous&lt;/em&gt; - wait times can be up to 2 hours. But with average full-price tickets being over $100, the 50%+ discounts offered at the booth are very tempting, and often worth the wait.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC09565.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The south edge of the square holds the NASDAQ building, home to the mainly tech-centric stock exchange. There's a large US Army recruiting booth, the American flag on its side lit garishly to match the surroundings. Giant Disney and Toys R Us stores also line the edge of the Square, along with the Times Square Museum. It's an iconic, expensive, and well-trafficked retail location - these spots get very crowded during the day, and people aimlessly wander in and out, dragged by children. friends, and partners. The bright lights, wall-to-wall advertising, huge plasticky stores surrounding and devouring customers really seems a metaphor for our modern consumer culture - and nowhere is this culture stronger than in New York, United States..  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC09566.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our final point of hilarity on this first night was seeing a big, empty Fosters can on the side of a food cart at the edge of the Square. Australians don't actually drink Fosters, despite the advertising to the contrary. Having had a good laugh, we closed the evening to be ready for a new day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;script type= "text/javascript"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our second and final day in DC dawned cloudy and cold, and it remained that way for the entirety of the day. Somewhat disappointed after the beautiful sunshine of the first day, we were still thankful that the rain stayed away. Our day began with breakfast at a little cafe called Teaism just in the Penn Quarter. They had a wide variety of interesting teas on offer as well as a decent breakfast selection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC09297.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following breakfast, our first stop was the National Air and Space Museum, another branch of the Smithsonian Institute. Located on the National Mall, close by the Natural History Museum, Air and Space is a must-see if you're an aviation buff of any kind (and let's face it, who isn't?). It is a huge two storey building filled to the brim with some of the greatest pieces of human engineering - the magnificent machines that take us around the world and to the stars.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC09320.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One brilliant feature of the museum is the emphasis on real artefacts over replicas. The lunar lander on display is one of twelve built for the Apollo moon landing program. This one was the second of two test landers built to test the separation and docking procedures in low Earth orbit; it was never used for this purpose because the first test was a complete success. Eventually, NASA transferred stewardship of the lander to the Smithsonian for display to the public alongside many other artefacts of the Apollo era. There's one of the test lunar rovers (used in the later Apollo missions) and a huge Saturn V engine along with spacesuits, and other gizmos.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC09346.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The museum even has the actual Apollo 11 command module, &lt;em&gt;Columbia&lt;/em&gt;. This is the real spaceship that was used by Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin, and Michael Collins to ride to and from the moon in July 1969. Burned brown from the heat of re-entry, it is encased in protective plastic and stands in the entrance atrium of the museum. I was fascinated by the Apollo space program as a child, and so I was fully geeking out over this real piece of history. I can only imagine the excitement that would have rippled across the US at the fulfilment of President Kennedy's bold proclamation to land a man on the moon before [the 1960's] were out.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC09326.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another Apollo-themed exhibit (just a replica this time) marks the first international manned space rendezvous - the 1975 docking of an American and a Russian manned spacecraft. This event marked the end of the space race that started with the launch of the Russian Sputnik in 1957. It was also the last flight for the Apollo hardware, and the last US spaceflight until the launch of the Space Shuttle in 1981. On the topic of the Space Shuttle, there is a section of the museum devoted purely to Shuttle flights. While the shuttle &lt;em&gt;Discovery&lt;/em&gt; is at a satellite facility of the museum out near Dulles airport (along with a SR-71 Blackbird and a Concorde), the National Mall location features smaller exhibits, including a touching tribute to Sally Ride, who died in mid-2012. Not only was Ride the first American woman in space, but she was also the first known LGBT astronaut - a mark which was not publicly revealed until after her passing.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC09304.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Orbiting the Earth from 1973 to 1979 was Skylab, the first space station launched by the United States. The station endured severe damage during its launch, necessitating substantial repair work before it became habitable (part of the repairs included a sun shade to replace a broken heat shield and freeing a stuck solar panel). There were three teams that occupied Skylab between 1973 and 1974, conducting scientific experiments in zero-gravity - particularly investigating the effects of prolonged weightlessness on the human body. Sadly, heightened sunspot activity in the late 1970s heated the Earth's upper atmosphere and increased the drag on Skylab, causing it to burn up in the Earth's atmosphere before the space shuttle was ready to potentially prolong its lifetime. Parts of Skylab landed near Perth, Western Australia after surviving the fiery re-entry process. On display in the museum is Skylab B, a flight-standard backup that was not launched into space due to the exorbitant costs involved. You can walk through the station to see just how cramped life in a space station actually is (pretty cramped!).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC09340.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The aviation side of the Air and Space museum is also fascinating. It covers everything from the Wright Brother's first flight to today's passenger and military jets. Having recently visited Pearl Harbour and in the midst of a modern history reading, I particularly liked the World War II display with P-51 Mustangs, Spitfires, and the Messerschmidt bf 109. Aerial combat has never been since been so devastating, and I'm awed by the bravery required to climb into one of these things and engage the enemy - day in and day out, over land and sea.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC09355.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having finished at the Air and Space Museum, we attempted to visit the Holocaust Museum just a short way up the road. The museum came highly recommended, and having been to the Memorial to the Murdered Jews in Berlin, I was curious to see what the equivalent would be in the US. Unfortunately, while entry is free, tickets are given out on a first-come first-served basis, and typically run out early in the morning. We thought we had managed to purchase tickets online for the day, but unfortunately the date turned out to be two months in the future, and we were prompted rejected at the entrance. So if you want to visit the museum on Sunday June 23rd at 2pm, get in touch.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC09358.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus discharged from the Holocaust Museum, we set out to see more landmarks on foot. Proceeding down the National Mall, we again passed the Washington Monument, which stands in a the middle of a straight line drawn from the US Capitol, down the National Mall to the Lincoln Memorial. The great obelisk commemorates George Washington, and is the tallest stone structure and tallest obelisk in the world at 170 metres. It is usually open for people to ascend to the top, but it is currently closed due to damage from the 2011 Virginia earthquake and Hurricane Irene. Cracks and leaks have been found inside the monument, and while it is apparently not in danger of falling down, it remains unsafe to be reopened to the public.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC09366.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further down the mall is the National World War II Memorial. Located at the eastern edge of the Reflecting Pool, it is one of the newest memorials in DC, having been completed in 2004. It is a pillar-encircled plaza and fountains, with the names of the fifty states inscribed on the pillars. Two arches stand at opposite ends of the monument, bearing the labels "Pacific" and "Atlantic" in reference to the two primary theatres of the war.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC09370.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walking along the Reflecting Pool leads you to one of the most iconic structures in Washington DC: the Abraham Lincoln Memorial. As President, Lincoln led the US through the Civil War, preserving the union and eliminating slavery. He presided at a time of great divisions across the country, even within the Union forces, and and delivered some of the most memorable quotes of history. Sadly, just six days after the surrender of Confederate forces and the end of the civil war, Lincoln was assassinated by Confederate sympathiser John Wilkes Booth in a theatre. Today, a great sculpted likeness of the man sits in the Memorial, gazing over the thousands who come to visit him each year. The walls of the Memorial bear his second inaugural address and the Gettysburg Address, the latter of which is the most quoted speech in American history. It's always noisy here during the daytime; hordes of schoolchildren and tourist constantly surround the building, and I wondered whether Mr Lincoln would have approved or disapproved of the cacophony that echoes around him. Given the rabble that he had to deal with, I imagine that he'd appreciate some long-won peace and quiet now.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC09401.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Memorial itself has borne witness to many titular events in the history of the capitol. The most notable of these is Martin Luther King Jr.'s famous "I Have A Dream" speech, delivered from the top of the Memorial's steps. Engraved into one of the tiles before the Memorial is a subtle tribute to King's momentous speech. I thought that it was especially appropriate that the civil rights leader delivered his most strident appeal for equality before the President whose Emancipation Proclamation put into motion the dissolution of African-American slavery in the US. The symbolism of two of the greatest orators in history coming together is also special.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC09407.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looping to the south of the Lincoln Memorial, we headed back towards the city centre, but closer to the Potomac river this time. Just away from the Lincoln is the Korean War Veterans Memorial, styled as a patrol of 19 soldiers out in the field. The soldiers represent each branch of the US military, cloaked in full combat gear and bearing expressions grim, watchful, and alert. On a wall nearby is the sombre inscription, "Freedom is not Free".  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC09413.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Across a nearby sports field is the Franklin D. Roosevelt Memorial. Commonly known as "FDR", Roosevelt won the Presidency a record four times, held the office for 12 years, and lead the US through the Great Depression and nearly to the end of World War II. His New Deal policies helped to lift the country from the depths of recession, and his ideology dominated US politics for decades to come. Along with his contemporary, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, he was a powerful orator, crafting memorable speeches to galvanise his people through the tumultuous years of his Presidency. Remarkably, FDR did all of this while totally paralysed from the waist down due to polio. His health failed him through the 1940s, and he died of a cerebral haemorrhage in 1945, just a month before the end of World War II. Today, the 22nd Amendment to the US Constitution forbids anyone from holding the Presidency for more than two consecutive terms, ensuring that FDR will be the only man to have been elected to the office more than twice.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC09422.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The FDR Memorial is a large outdoor area divided into four main sections - one for each of FDR's terms of office. The walls are adorned with quotes, and sculptures of the President, his wife Eleanor, and scenes from the Great Depression litter the compound. The memorial is not grand like the Lincoln or Jefferson, but it is quietly dignified. FDR purportedly preferred for a smaller memorial marker, and one according to his wishes is located in front of the National Archives building on Pennsylvania Ave in the city.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC09431.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crossing the bridge at the south end of the Tidal Basin, we finally made it to the Jefferson Memorial. This is dedicated to Thomas Jefferson, the third US President and principal author of the Declaration of Independence. Inside the pantheon-like structure stands an enormous bronze sculpture of Jefferson staring due north towards the White House (though the executive mansion isn't actually visible from the memorial). The walls inside are marked with extracts from the Declaration of Independence, including the iconic "We hold these truths to be self-evident...". Around the building and the Tidal Pool on which it stands are thousands of Japanese cherry trees, given as a gift of peace from the Japanese people in 1912. The mass blooming of the trees in spring each year is celebrated in the capital, and we were sadly two weeks too early to catch the flowers (though some cherry trees around the city had bloomed early, adding colour to the grey stones).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC09439.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walking back towards the National Mall from the Jefferson Memorial, we hailed a cab to head out of DC to Arlington. The capitol sits on the south edge of the state of Maryland and the north edge of Virginia, and Arlington lies just to the south over the Potomac river. The taxi took us to the US Air Force Memorial, and a view over the Pentagon. The headquarters of the US Defense Force, the Pentagon consists of five concentric rings, each with five sides. It is the largest office building by internal space in the world, and contains nearly 30 kilometres of corridors! We couldn't get any closer to the Pentagon as it was a weekend (there are tours available during the week), and the building itself is not much to look at unless you're higher in the sky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC09450.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Across from the Pentagon and the Air Force Memorial is the Arlington National Cemetery. Veterans of the armed forces and those killed in action may choose to be interned here. President John F. Kennedy was buried here after his assassination in 1963, and today his wife, two of his children, and his two brothers are also buried at Arlington. There is something sobering about seeing the neat rows of little white crosses dotting the green hills of the cemetery. This is a place of mourning, a symbol of the enormous price paid in the conflicts of man. Every grave bears a story, a knot of grief, family and loved ones who have lost someone precious to them.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC09456.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Air Force Memorial itself is centred around three tall spires that represent the contrails of the Air Force Thunderbird's signature "bomb blast" manoeuvre. It is one of the lesser visited sites in the region; we certainly would not have gotten there without taking a taxi or driving since it is some distance away from local public transport. We took a walk from the Memorial to the nearby Pentagon City shopping mall; we grabbed a bite to eat before heading back into DC on the metro.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC09460.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our day in Washington DC ended with a pizza dinner and gelato dessert before an early night at the hotel. Tara had a 7am flight to catch, and I had a 6am bus ride for the Big Apple: New York City. I greatly enjoyed Washington DC; it is full of iconic sights and a multitude of free and amazing museums. It's also generally easy to navigate and get around via the metro system. I'll have to come back sometime to see more of the Smithsonian, catch more tours, and explore further.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Washington DC"></category><category term="Travel"></category><category term="USA"></category></entry><entry><title>East Coast (II): Washington DC, Day 1</title><link href="http://dominickng.com/blog/2013/05/east-coast-ii-washington-dc-day-1/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2013-05-01T00:00:00+10:00</updated><author><name>Dominick Ng</name></author><id>tag:dominickng.com,2013-05-01:blog/2013/05/east-coast-ii-washington-dc-day-1/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Following Detroit, I flew to Washington DC, meeting up with my friend Tara for a weekend exploring the capitol. This is the second in a series of posts about my East Coast US trip in March 2013 (see the first part &lt;a href="http://blog.dominickng.com/2013/04/east-coast-i-pitstop-in-detroit.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC09130.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As my sole day in Detroit wound to a close, I chilled with Patrick and Elizabeth at their apartment before heading back to the airport. This was my second flight with Delta Airlines and it would take me to Baltimore Airport, from which I would transit to Washington DC. Unfortunately, this flight again struck problems. Just after our scheduled departure time, the captain announced that a fuel leak had been found in the right wing. The mandated test for this is to let it leak for a certain period of time to determine if the leak is within standard bounds (yes, seriously), so we sat on the plane and waited. Once the time was up, the captain returned to tell us that the right wing fuel leak had abated, but_ another_ fuel leak had been found in the left wing. The whole process repeated itself, and by the time the left leak was declared as being nonthreatening we were an hour late again.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Touching down in Baltimore, I sprinted through the terminal to make a bus connection. Baltimore is approximately 40 minutes from DC via public transport. I had hoped to be early in order to catch the more direct train, but the flight problems put paid to that. Instead, I had to make do with a bus service to the outer stations of Washington's metro line, switching onto the metro to reach my hotel near Union Station. A light rain was falling as we pulled in, and I grabbed a late dinner before heading to the hotel.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC09149.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was in DC alone for the first night, as Tara would not arrive until the next morning. Having nothing better to do, I departed the hotel around 11pm for a walk around the city. I guessed that there would be interesting things to take photos of, and I was not disappointed. The hotel was just down the street from the US Capitol Building, and I walked up the hill towards it happily snapping away. By now the rain had faded away, leaving the ground wet but the sky dry. However, the bitter cold of Detroit was still present in DC; my hands strayed out of their gloves only when necessary for camera manipulation; and I was well wrapped against the chill.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC09151.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US Capitol is truly impressive. Whilst I had seen something of its general design before at the &lt;a href="http://blog.dominickng.com/2012/12/thanksgiving-mormons-temples-salt-lake.html"&gt;Utah State Capitol building&lt;/a&gt;, the real thing was far grander. The dome is floodlit from below and shines brightly in the night, giving perfect views from all sides. As expected, there is ample security, and you cannot get close to any of the staircases into the building. Just behind the Capitol is the Supreme Court and the Library of Congress, but neither were lit up, and the Court was wreathed in scaffolding that put paid to any picture opportunities.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC09138.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the opposite side of the Capitol building to the Supreme Court is the National Mall, a long strip of grass separating roads leading down to the iconic Washington Monument. Many of the museums of the Smithsonian Institute line the Mall, making it one of the most concentrated areas of human knowledge and history in the world. It was extremely quiet here at this late hour, meaning a pristine environment for long exposure photography. I took the above shot with my &lt;a href="http://blog.dominickng.com/2012/10/night-photography.html"&gt;NEX-5&lt;/a&gt; at ISO 200, F16 aperture, and a 25 second exposure.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC09174.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I finally finished taking photos at the Capitol, and decided to walk down nearby Pennsylvannia Ave to number 1600, i.e. the White House. I was hoping that it would be similarly spectacular. Along the way are many notable buildings; several more of the Smithsonian Institute, the Newseum Museum of News, and the J. Edgar Hoover building, headquarters of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The Hoover building is a unsightly monolith of grey concrete, whilst the museum buildings were more tasteful decorated in the stone column style.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC09166.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, by the time I completed the three kilometre walk to the White House, I was starkly reminded that it is actually a residence as well as a tourist attraction; the only thing lit up was the American flag flying from its roof. I managed to snag the above shot using my camera's Twilight mode: it takes six shots at a relatively fast shutter speed and high ISO, and combines them into one image. This has the advantage of not requiring a tripod for night shooting, though the pictures it produces aren't quite as clean. Thus defeated, I trouped back to the hotel to await the next day and better sightseeing opportunities.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC09177.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tara arrived early the next morning, and following breakfast we set out on our first appointment: a tour inside the Capitol building. We had prebooked tickets online (you can do so from the Capitol Visitor website, or your local Congressional representatives). The day had dawned in glorious sunshine, and we enjoyed walking around under the beautiful blue skies. There was an &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; long security line at the Capitol Visitor Centre (just behind the building itself), but the line moved reasonably quickly and we were inside in about 20 minutes. The tour staging area is known as Emancipation Hall, and it is an enormous underground room typically filled with hundreds of people beginning, proceeding through, and finishing tours. Unfortunately, the slow security line meant that we had missed out scheduled tour time, but it was an easy thing to go up to the prebooked ticket desk and have a new time scheduled almost immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC09218.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first stop of the tour was a theatre where we were shown an introductory video on the Capitol and Congress. Themed "We the people", the opening statement of the US Constitution, the video sketched a history of the democratic process in the United States. Unfortunately, in the context of today's hostile and partisan Congressional atmosphere, some of the video's message on compromise felt a bit forced. However, it still did a fine job conveying the spirit in which the world's leading democracy styles its representative system.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC09183.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the video, we proceeded out of the theatre and into the subterranean levels deep under the Capitol Dome. Originally, the remains of George Washington were to be housed in a vault here, but his will stipulated that he wished to be buried at his home in Mount Vernon. To this day, the vault remains empty and is unlikely to be filled. Here we also saw the first of the many, many statues that line the halls and rooms of the Capitol. Each state was asked to donate two statues to the national collection that honoured notable persons in their history; the resulting collection is an eclectic mix of presidents, patriots, activists, astronauts, and more.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC09184.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, we climbed upstairs and into the wide Capitol Rotunda underneath the dome. Important ceremonial events take place in here, including the lying in state of notable citizens, or the dedication of a new work of art. The rotunda is gloriously decorated. featuring enormous artworks of major elements of American history, more statues from the national collection, and a fresco timeline of the development of America. Several large cracks in the wall also featured; these were remnants of the damage done by a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Virginia_earthquake"&gt;2011 earthquake&lt;/a&gt; measuring 5.8 on the Richter scale. The dome itself rises 88m tall, and is a cast iron structure that replaced an earlier, smaller, and wooden dome. Completed during the Civil War, President Lincoln viewed the progress of the dome as a sign that the Union would hold strong and rise again. The underside of the dome is decorated with a fresco entitled "The Apotheosis of Washington"; it features George Washington (upside down in the above photo) rising to glory flanked by Liberty and Victory. Other figures in the fresco include Benjamin Franklin, Samuel Morse, and figures of War, Science, Marine, Commerce, Mechanics, and Agriculture, symbolising the development and pride of the fledgling nation.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC09207.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On top of the Capitol building is a distinct greenish statue. It is the six-metre tall &lt;em&gt;Freedom;&lt;/em&gt; a woman cast in bronze bearing a sheathed sword in one hand and a laurel wreath in the other. At her base on the building is a half globe bearing a national motto, &lt;em&gt;E pluribus unum&lt;/em&gt; - "Out of many, one". The original plaster cast of the statue, designed by Thomas Crawford in his studio in Rome, is on display in Emancipation Hall for visitors to see up close in all its glory. It doesn't look all that large standing on top of the dome, but it is very tall in person, reminding you of the wonders of perspective and distance.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC09243.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were getting hungry as we finished at Congress, so we retraced my steps from the previous night to head towards the White House and the nearby Old Ebbitt Grill. The Grill is a restaurant and an oyster bar that's situated about as close as you can get to the White House without scaling a fence. It's been around for over 150 years, and once upon a time was popular with Presidents, including Teddy Roosevelt. Today the crowd is more touristy (with the occasional political staffer or journalist), but the Grill still serves a pretty mean eggs with crabcakes for brunch. Thus sated, we strolled over to perhaps the most famous residence in the world, now lit by the beautiful sunshine of a spring afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC09222.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is something glorious about seeing the White House in person. Stately it stands, the symbol of US executive power and influence the world over. Hoards of tourists at front and back crowd to take photos with the famous residence, with guards keeping a very watchful eye on everyone. Unfortunately, I was bitterly disappointed to find that while tours used to be offered for the building, these have been suspended in the light of sequestration budget cuts. Additionally, President Obama was not in town whilst we were in Washington DC; at the time he was still in the Middle East en route back home.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC09254.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the British scientist James Smithson died in 1829, he left most of his wealth to a nephew. But since the nephew died without children in 1835, the bulk of his uncle's estate passed on "to the United States of America, to found at Washington, under the name of the Smithsonian Institution, an Establishment for the increase &amp;amp; diffusion of knowledge among men." Today, the Smithsonian Institute holds 130 million items of artistic, historic, anthropological, architectural, and natural significance. Centred in Washington, visitors to its 19 museums are admitted without charge. After the White House we wandered past the Washington Monument and up to the nearby Natural History Museum of the Smithsonian. It is an incredible place, allowing you to stroll all corners of the globe underneath its green dome. There's a giant blue whale swimming above the ocean section, a huge elephant under the dome, and countless other treasures scattered through the halls.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC09280.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most spectacular exhibits in the Natural History Museum was the butterfly enclosure. Well worth the cost of the addition ticket, it is a plant-filled room teeming with butterflies of all species. Riotously colourful, the butterflies swoop and flutter freely, around and over you, with mist jets keeping the atmosphere comfortable and feeding stations providing fruit and nectar to sate the insects. I had a good time practicing some macro photography (like the above photo) along the way.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC09290.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our final stop for the day was the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. Both a memorial to President John F. Kennedy and a national showcase of the best music, dance, and theatre productions, the Center is the busiest such facility in the United States. We had bought tickets to see a production of &lt;em&gt;Shear Madness&lt;/em&gt;, a play depicting the fallout of a murder above a hair salon. There are just six characters: a stereotypically campy male hairdresser, a more down to earth female hairdresser, a self-important business man, a wealthy socialite, and the police investigator and his partner. The unique thing about it is the audience participation; audience members contribute to the investigation of the murder and shape its eventual outcome. The night that we went was packed with schoolkids who had a raucously good time interacting with the performers and enjoying the clear stereotypes on show. It struck me as a very American show - loud and over the top - and while it wasn't quite to our tastes, it clearly had its intended audience in stitches.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC09248.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus our first day in DC came to a close. Next time I'll cover part 2 of Washington DC, including the National Air and Space Museum, the Lincoln Memorial, and a brief foray into Virginia. &lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Washington DC"></category><category term="Travel"></category><category term="USA"></category></entry><entry><title>Terror and the USA</title><link href="http://dominickng.com/blog/2013/04/terror-and-usa/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2013-04-24T00:00:00+10:00</updated><author><name>Dominick Ng</name></author><id>tag:dominickng.com,2013-04-24:blog/2013/04/terror-and-usa/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;On December 14th, 2012, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandy_Hook_Elementary_School_shooting"&gt;Adam Lanza went on a rampage&lt;/a&gt; at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut. Using his mother's own guns, he shot and killed her in their house, and proceeded to murder twenty children and six staff members at the school where she worked. As first responders closed in, he committed suicide by shooting himself through the head. On April 17th 2013, gun control measures to improve criminal background checks, ban assault rifles, and limit the size of magazines was defeated in the US Senate following heavy lobbying by the National Rifle Association.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Late during the Boston Marathon on April 15th, 2013, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Marathon_bombings"&gt;two explosive devices were detonated&lt;/a&gt; near the finish line of the race. Three people were killed, including an eight year old boy watching his father run in the race, a young restaurant manager, and a Chinese graduate student at Boston University. Hundreds were injured, from superficial cuts to missing limbs. In an unrelated incident, a fire broke out at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Memorial in Boston, causing an evacuation and fears of a simultaneous attack. In the aftermath, amid a massive FBI investigation into the perpetrators, amateur sleuths from Reddit and 4chan &lt;a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/online-sleuths-boston-manhunt-reddit-4chan-article-1.1322658"&gt;incorrectly accused a 17 year old spectator and a missing Brown university student&lt;/a&gt; of being involved. The teenager has his picture put up all over the internet, and is afraid to leave his house. The family of the missing student, already devastated with worry, were forced to take down Facebook pages pleading for information, and underwent even more unnecessary trauma thanks to the false identifications.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On April 16th and 17th, 2013, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_ricin_attacks"&gt;letters laced with the deadly poison ricin&lt;/a&gt; were intercepted in Washington DC. One was mailed to a US Senator, and another to the US President Barack Obama. So far, an Elvis impersonator has been detained for mailing the letters, though he was later released without charges amidst evidence that he was being framed.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A fire broke out at the West Fertilizer Company storage and distribution plant near Waco, Texas on April 17th, 2013. As firefighters fought the flames, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Fertilizer_Company_explosion"&gt;a massive explosion erupted&lt;/a&gt; from the facility, levelling hundreds of buildings in the area and sending up a huge mushroom cloud into the air. At least fifteen people have been killed (mostly firefighters called in after the initial fire), and hundreds are injured. The shock wave from the explosion blew out windows for kilometres around, and the force of the disaster registered 2.1 on the Richter scale. While the incident is not regarded as suspicious, its timing immediately following the Marathon bombing was chilling.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following a holdup at a local 7-Eleven, a campus disturbance was reported at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, just across the river from Boston, late on April 18th, 2013. MIT Police officer Sean Collier was shot, and later died of his wounds in hospital. A massive manhunt was instigated for brothers Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, believed to have been behind the hold up, the shooting, and the Marathon bombings. It was a night of chaos, with millions around the world following via police radio scanners and social media. Fragmented, conflicting reports of hijackings, gun battles, explosions, and bombs bounced back and forth like lightning. Tamerlan died during the battles in the night, and Boston was practically shut down for a day as police combed the city and its suburbs for his brother. Eventually, Dzhokhar was found heavily injured and hidden in a boat in a backyard. He may face the death penalty for his crimes, and his capture resulted in mass street &lt;a href="http://news.yahoo.com/boston-beyond-thanks-jubilation-080556734.html"&gt;celebrations in the locked-down city&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barely an afterthought was the news of a mass shooting in Seattle, Washington on April 22nd. &lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com/2013/04/22/justice/seattle-shooting/index.html"&gt;A domestic dispute&lt;/a&gt; led to a gunman killing his girlfriend, a neighbour, and two other men before police killed him. The gunman had a valid concealed weapons permit. Such was the week preceding that this news was far overshadowed, and ranked just small headlines on news front pages.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I honestly feel less safe in the US than in Australia. Despite being ensconced behind the greatest arsenal in the history of the world, I find it hard to entirely shake off a sense of insecurity. I'm extra watchful if I'm walking alone at night, or in areas that I do not know well. Not being able to see people's faces or hands on ill-lit streets puts me on edge. I vaguely worry about earthquakes and industrial accidents, even though the likelihood of either is remote.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue of guns in the US is particularly upsetting. It may be part of my upbringing in Australia, but I do not believe that the &lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2012/12/21/167785169/live-blog-nra-news-conference"&gt;only thing that can stop a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun&lt;/a&gt;. I want there to be no need for either to have guns in the first place. I want there to be no one sufficiently enraged or desperate to use one. It sickens me that people are capable of murdering twenty children, maiming hundreds, or killing over a domestic dispute. It sickens me that people feel the need to possess high-powered weaponry as a purely defensive measure. The sight of arms or armed guards makes me uneasy, as if their presence suggests a real and present danger. But, while &lt;a href="http://vimeo.com/64432171"&gt;gun control&lt;/a&gt; was an incredible success in Australia, but I fear that our precedent is simply incompatible with the expectations of gun rights in the US. Powerful lobby groups aside, I sadly think that mass shootings simply increase the resolve of many Americans to hold onto their guns. You just cannot win when such a culture pervades the people.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps my impressions of safety in the US are coloured by my arrival experience. Before I had even made it off the airport train in August 2012, someone tried to steal my phone right out of my hand. He did not succeed thanks to the intervention of a complete stranger sitting behind me on the train, who pursued and tackled would-be thief. All of happened as the train pulled into a station in the middle of San Francisco. To this day, I feel tense at that station and in the areas around it, and I'm on guard when I'm riding on the trains. There are streets just blocks away from the city centre that I don't like to walk down.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The United States and Australia are similar in several ways, being relatively young, advanced economies with diverse populations. But the history of the US has been defined by conflict both internal and external: wars to secure the country, its independence, and its ideological identity, and wars to shape the world that we know now. Australia has played but a minor part in these global conflicts, and has not torn itself apart in civil war. In a way, I feel like war is ingrained in the American identity. Its activist (some would call it interfering) streak and superpower status ensures that the United States remains deeply involved in matters of global conflict. Moreover, its history and people demand it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeing the events at Boston was surreal for me. I visited the city just two weeks prior to the Marathon bombings, walking around the Public Library and Copley Square where the bombs exploded, and taking pictures of the Stata Building at MIT where Officer Collier - a good guy with a gun - was killed. I stayed with a friend whom I had met in Australia; when the bombs went off she was having lunch in a cafe just a block away from, and is thankfully safe and sound. Boston is a beautiful city, full of life, history, and pride, and I feel very sad at the terror that has struck at it. And this extends to many parts of the United States. The country is breathtakingly, stunningly beautiful, full of incredible landscapes and cityscapes, wild natures and feats of engineering. In my travels so far I have yet to be disappointed at the sights and sounds. It is also the centre of the academic and industrial universes, the place to be on the cutting edge.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some have commented (often flippantly) that destruction and death is par for the course in many countries around the world, and that the outcry for Boston was immeasurably overstated given the final toll. But I do not believe that peace and security in one part of the world can be traded for that in another. Boston is not a war zone, and the city is not the site of brutal civil wars or conflicts. It is not a police state with tight security over its people, curfews in the night hours, and restrictions on what one may do. Its people had the fortune to live in what they thought was a safe place. I am sad for those who have the misfortune to land in the dangerous corners of the world, and for the many who pay for it with their lives every day. I wish that these corners were eradicated, and feel ashamed that they still exist. But I do not dismiss what happened in Boston because of them.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps it's unsurprising that insecurity pervades the richest nation in the world. The United States is a complicated place of contradictions, incredibly wealthy and beautiful, but beset by fear, social problems, and economic inequities. It occupies a unique place in an envious and sometimes hostile world. While it's easy to preach and scoff, in the end it's truly not easy being American. They bear a heavy burden, and pay for it every single day. I'm not sure if I would want to carry that load as well for the rest of my life. &lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Terrorism"></category><category term="USA"></category></entry><entry><title>East Coast (I): A pitstop in Detroit</title><link href="http://dominickng.com/blog/2013/04/east-coast-i-pitstop-in-detroit/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2013-04-17T00:00:00+10:00</updated><author><name>Dominick Ng</name></author><id>tag:dominickng.com,2013-04-17:blog/2013/04/east-coast-i-pitstop-in-detroit/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Over spring break in late March, I trekked across the East Coast of the United States. It was my first visit across that side of the country, and I covered a substantial amount of ground. This will be a series of posts on my travels and the things I saw along the way. Stop one on my trip was the Midwest heartland and the city of Detroit, Michigan, which I spent a day visiting my old friends Patrick and Elizabeth. They were students on exchange in Australia when I met them during my undergraduate degree, and have since moved back to the US and established themselves in Michigan. Patrick graciously took the day off work to show me around.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took a red-eye flight leaving San Francisco for Detroit. If you're unfamiliar with the nomenclature, red-eye flights leave very late at night (typically close to midnight), and land early in the morning. The basic deal is that you give up quality (and length) of sleep, but don't lose a day to flying. Unfortunately for me, someone in the Delta Airlines command chain forgot to refuel our aircraft, and so we sat on the plane for nearly an hour whilst the problem was addressed. Finally, we took off roughly sixty minutes behind schedule, and landed around 7:30am at Detroit Wayne County airport. This would prove to be an inauspicious beginning to the flying legs of my trip.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/IMG_0642.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;What does opportunity look like?&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Detroit was &lt;em&gt;freezing&lt;/em&gt; cold; the temperature hovered at close to zero Celsius for most of the day, and an icy wind howled around the city for the day that I was there. I was told that this is typical weather for this time of year, and indeed, chill would be a theme of this trip across the US. I learnt very quickly that winter hangs around for quite some time - even in March, the temperature is low enough in Detroit for large piles of ploughed snow to remain for days, despite the presence of blue skies and sunshine. I had booked my East Coast trip in late March anticipating that I would miss the worst of winter; while this was certainly true, it definitely wasn't warm.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/IMG_0644.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These days, Detroit has become synonymous with urban decay. The city was once great and glorious, powered by the automotive industry and the Motown music scene. But the population peaked in the 1950s at 1.8 million; by 2010, that number would fall 60% to 700,000. The decline of the US automotive industry and the exodus of people to the suburbs or other states has dramatically affected the city. Abandoned and burned-out buildings are &lt;em&gt;everywhere&lt;/em&gt; - even in the city centre. I had never before seen anything quite like it. Many parts of the city are so sparsely populated that municipal services are difficult to provide - even basics such as policing, fire protection, garbage collection, and lighting. The sheer scale of abandoned property makes arson common and difficult to counter - hence the scores of burned out buildings. Something that struck me as I looked through the photos I took was the near-complete absence of colour. The cold winter had bleached the ground brown, and the prevailing colour of practically every building was brown or beaten grey. The overcast day really added to the impression of colourlessness.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/IMG_0650.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One surviving relic of the city's former wealth is the Detroit Institute of Arts (DIA). Housed in a spectacular stone building on the Wayne State University campus, the DIA is enormous and filled to the brim with excellent exhibits. Just out the front is one of Rodin's many busts of the &lt;em&gt;Thinker&lt;/em&gt;, one of twelve in the United States, and within are artefacts and trinkets, sculptures and busts, recreations and models, and glorious artworks from throughout history. There was a beautiful projection onto a table depicting the lavish extravagance of an aristocratic meal. Collections of mediaeval armour lined the main hall, whilst other wings showed off collections of Asian, European, and American art.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/IMG_0651.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Four Vincent van Gogh paintings formed the centrepiece of the display at the DIA. Three of these are owned by the city, including a self portrait, '&lt;em&gt;The Diggers&lt;/em&gt;', and '&lt;em&gt;Portrait of Postman Roulin'&lt;/em&gt;, and each is famous enough that I recognised all of them. The fourth painting was the very famous '&lt;em&gt;Bedroom in Arles&lt;/em&gt;', on loan from the Musee d'Orsay in Paris. Sadly, photography of the van Gogh exhibit was forbidden, but Patrick and I spent a good amount of time roaming the DIA and perusing its wares. I learned later that the art collection of the museum is valued at over a billion dollars, and it is the second largest publicly owned museum in the United States. The splendour of the institute stood in stark contrast to the city it inhabits, a paean to a bygone era.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/IMG_0658.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The Fisher Building in the city centre&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The city centre is strangely empty. Where a large shopping mall once stood now sits a huge carpark; the enormous support columns of the old mall still rise from the ground, as if in hope for something to return. Large, gloriously architectured buildings rise into the sky, but each one looks as if it has seen better days. Indeed, the city features an amazing variety of styles, from New England townhouses to art-deco facades and modern glass skyscrapers. Driving around the city is like taking a walk through a living history of the United States and its tastes through time. But many of the buildings are, like the city, shadows of their former selves. The usual hustle and bustle of a big city, the background thrum of activity, just isn't present here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/IMG_0665.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Detroit sprawls out over a massive area; yet there is enough vacant land within the city for Paris to fit comfortably. In the formerly affluent areas to the north of the city, enormous mansions lie empty, foreclosed, and for sale. Above is a six bedroom house on Chicago Boulevard, north of the city centre, and it can be yours for less than $300,000. It will probably require a lot of fixing up, and the rest of the neighbourhood is similarly run down, but that's what it's like right now across much of the city.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/IMG_0669.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The Detroit skyline from Belle Isle&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The city sits on the shores of the Detroit River, with the US - Canada border cutting along the centre of the waterway and the Canadian city of Windsor just across. On the US side of the river is Belle Isle, a large nature park that affords a great view of the city. When we visited, the remnants of a motor race was still evident on the isle in half-dismantled grandstands and kerbing along the roads. Fountains, museums, yacht clubs, and golf courses dot the island, but many of them were abandoned, or closed for repair or due to the icy weather. We found a small &lt;a href="http://detroitzoo.org/plan/belle-isle-nature-zoo"&gt;nature zoo&lt;/a&gt; on the eastern side that featured flora and fauna of the state of Michigan. Like much of the city, the zoo was a work in progress: entry was free, and there was construction ongoing. Much to our dismay, we just missed out on the 1 pm deer feeding session, but we able to catch a glimpse of several amphibious, aquatic, and airborne species native to the Great Lakes state. Particularly cool was a display where native birds were enticed to a window with perches and food, allowing a close up view.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/IMG_0679.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following a delicious pizza lunch, we made our way to a destination that was suggested as a must-see. And indeed, there is perhaps no more compelling symbol of the former splendour and current decay of Detroit than the enormous Michigan Central Station. Constructed in 1913 and designed by the same architect as Grand Central Station in New York, over two hundred trains a day left the station at its peak prior to World War I, and even in the 1940s thousands of people worked in the available office spaces. But the inexorable popularity of cars saw the station finally abandoned and service discontinued in 1988. The building has been empty and derelict ever since, save for the occasional movie shoot or illegal rave. Today, it is fenced off, standing forlornly behind the large Roosevelt Park. Just a few windows retain their original glass, and the wind howls through the building, curling around the lone American flag flying in front. It is an almost tragic scene, representing the dark side of industrialisation and capitalism. I can only imagine how grand it must have been at its peak.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/IMG_0696.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a field near the railway station sat a curious urban art exhibit in the form of putt-putt golf. Each hole was assembled from rusted, broken, castoff, and scavenged pieces of all sorts of things. One hole ran the ball through a rusted car, via the bonnet and out the tailpipe at the back to the hole. Another took the ball up and down long pipe sections before dropping onto a concrete green. The clubhouse was made of what appeared to be burned out timbers collected from an abandoned home. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/IMG_0701.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just behind the art installation is the Imagination Station - a performance space that has been gutted by fire. Occurrences like this are reportedly all too common in Detroit, and sadly, the problems seem to be exacerbated by rather than addressed by all levels of government. The city is deeply in debt, but income continues to drop precipitously due to unpaid taxes and the shrinking population. In March 2013 an emergency administrator was appointed to run the city due to its extreme fiscal problems, and it's possible that the city may declare bankruptcy in what would be the largest municipal government failure in history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/IMG_0711.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Detroit today is a grim place, but not without some hope for the future. Just today I saw an article on &lt;a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/3007840/creative-conversations/how-young-community-entrepreneurs-rebuilding-detroit"&gt;how young entrepreneurs are trying to rebuild the city&lt;/a&gt;, piece by piece. There are others like Patrick and Elizabeth who have staked their turf, investing in property for the long haul. There are many problems facing the city in its immediate future, but maybe someday I can return to Detroit and see a city rising up off the ground where it fell, and finding again its place amongst the great cities of America.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Detroit"></category><category term="Michigan"></category><category term="Travel"></category><category term="USA"></category></entry><entry><title>Alcatraz Island</title><link href="http://dominickng.com/blog/2013/04/alcatraz-island/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2013-04-04T00:00:00+11:00</updated><author><name>Dominick Ng</name></author><id>tag:dominickng.com,2013-04-04:blog/2013/04/alcatraz-island/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Sitting in the middle of San Francisco Bay, just a couple of kilometres from the shore, is one of the most notorious islands in US history: Alcatraz. The very name invokes dread imagery, a reputation forged on the backs of notorious criminals, impregnable walls, and Hollywood drama. Yet behind the hype, "The Rock" has a storied history beyond its time as a prison. I visited in early February, taking a night tour of the island.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC08844.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alcatraz Cruises is the company in charge of tours to Alcatraz. They work with the federal National Parks Service in providing access to the island, and the tours are very reasonably priced at around thirty dollars. There are day and night tours available; the night tour leaves San Francisco around 4:30pm, and as you approach the ferry encircles the island to reach its pier, giving you a spectacular view. A brief commentary about the island's history plays out as you cross the Bay and dock. Then, as you arrive, you are sectioned off into groups with a tour guide, who walks you up the hill toward the main prison buildings. The walk is punctuated by several stops explaining the significance of buildings, artefacts, and other locations on the climb.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC08961.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alcatraz was initially used as a military garrison and prison by the US Army during the American civil war - nearly 100 years before it became a federal prison. The walk up the hill passes the old fortifications on the island; it was once home to hundreds of cannons that defended the vitally important port of San Francisco in the 1800s. The cannons on the island were never fired in anger, and today a few remain preserved on the island.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC08867.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1933, control of the facility was transferred to the Federal Bureau of Prisons. It was converted island into a maximum security jail - an inescapable fortress that would hold the troublemakers from other prisons. Alcatraz was where you were sent if you misbehaved in another institution - the Rock invitingly close to San Francisco, but surrounded by the icy cold waters of the Bay. Alcatraz was ordered closed as a prison in 1963 due to severe degradation of the buildings, and high running costs (triple that of other prisons). Following its closure, the island was taken over as a protest ground against the government by Native American activists (hence the Indians welcome graffiti in the above picture). The activists stayed for nearly two years before the federal government eased policies designed to end the recognition of Native American tribes and their ancestral lands. This paved the way for the designation of the island as a National Park.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC08868.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alcatraz Prison is famed for the many escape plans conceived and attempted from the island. The prison officially claims that no prisoner has successfully escaped; out of the 36 inmates who attempted escapes, all but five were recaptured or killed. The remaining five are missing, presumed drowned. Our guide shared the meticulously planned 1945 escape attempt of John Giles, who was assigned to work on the docks during his incarceration. He had gradually stolen all of the components of a US Army staff sergeant uniform over several years. One day, when the prison launch pulled up to the dock, Giles donned the stolen uniform and boarded the boat, successfully making it off the island. Unfortunately, he was quickly discovered to be missing, and was met at the boat's destination by prison officers who escorted him back to the prison.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC08870.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the top of the hill we were ushered into the main prison block building, and supplied with a complimentary audio tour. The tour is narrated by former inmates and guards of the penitentiary, and walks you through the block, talking about life in the prison. The grim conditions in the prison were espoused by the rules and regulations: "You are entitled to food, clothing, shelter and medical attention. Anything else that you get is a privilege. You earn your privileges by conducting yourself properly." The tiny cells housed the worst criminals of the American prison system  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC08874.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Battle of Alcatraz in May 1946 was the result of the most violent escape attempt from the prison. Two inmates overpowered a guard and used his keys to release two more inmates from their cells. They used an improvised bar-spreading device to widen the iron bars protecting a gun store; one of the inmates had starved himself in the leadup to the escape attempt in order to fit through. Now armed, the would-be escapees intended to locate the key to the prison yard door, allowing them to make their way to the dock, seize the prison launch boat, and make their way to the shore and freedom. Unfortunately, the lock jammed due to their repeated attempts to open it, and the inmates were trapped in the prison block, along with several guards whom they had taken as hostages. The missing guards were noted and the escapees discovered, trapped in the main cellhouse. Platoons of Marines were called in, and so began a three day standoff punctuated by intensive gunfire, grenade attacks, and mortar assaults. By the end, two guards and three inmates were dead, and a further two inmates would be executed for their role in the battle.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC08878.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most intricate escape attempt from Alcatraz came in June 1962. Frank Morris, Clarence Anglin, and John Anglin discovered that behind their cells was an unused service corridor. They spent a year digging holes in their cell walls using spoons, covering the noise with accordion playing and concealing their progress with false walls. As this was progressing, they removed the rivets from an air vent at the top of the service corridor (substituting soap for any guards who cared to check), and stole raincoats and ropes to fashion a makeshift raft hidden under sheets on the prison roof. They also fashioned paper-mache dummy heads, furnishing them with real hair stolen from the prison barber shop. On the night of the escape, the inmates arranged pillows on their beds, and placed the heads at the top. They crawled out through the holes, and climbed up the service corridor, through the air vent to the roof. Scaling a fence and dodging spotlights and patrols, the trio made their way to the shore, where they pushed off the island and started paddling. It was approximately 10pm, June 11th, 1962.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC08915.JPG"&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Imagine digging that hole in the background with a spoon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Morris and the Anglin brothers were never seen again. When their absence was discovered the following morning, Alcatraz and nearby Angel Island were searched in vain; while remnants of the raft, paddles, and personal items were found on Angel Island, the men had vanished. Officially, the FBI concluded after a 17 year investigation that the men had drowned in the Bay. But there are still some who believe that the inmates survived and made it to the shore, and conspiracy theories abound regarding stolen vehicles, organised rendezvouses, mysterious Christmas cards, and strangers at mothers' funerals. Now, the escapees would be in their eighties, and I guess only they know what truly happened.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC08889.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alcatraz affords some spectacular views of the Bay and San Francisco. My inner photography geek was captivated by the late afternoon scenery of the city and the Golden Gate Bridge, and I took some time with the audio tour on pause to snap some shots. It would have been excruciating as a prisoner to see the city so close, yet so far out of reach.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC08903.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back inside, the audio tour concludes on the ground floor of the prison, leaving you free to explore the remainder of the penitentiary. There are additional presentations and talks, as well as a gift shop on the site. Upstairs is the hospital facility, and the cell of one Robert Stroud - the famed "Birdman of Alcatraz". Stroud was a particularly violent inmate who started caring for and raising birds whilst he was imprisoned at Leavenworth. He became somewhat respected in ornithological circles, authoring two books on bird diseases and engaging in such correspondence that checking and approving his mail occupied a full-time prison secretary. Eventually Stroud was transferred to Alcatraz, where he was forbidden to keep his pets (making the Birdman name somewhat incongruous!), and spent 17 years in the Rock. Another legendary occupant of Alcatraz who spent appreciable time in the hospital was on Al "Scarface" Capone, the noted Prohibition-era gangster. Having contracted syphilis as a youth, Capone's last year in Alcatraz was spent in the hospital, confused and disoriented due to the progress of the disease. When released, he was but a shadow of his former self.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC08920.JPG"&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The Birdman's hospital room&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I strolled back outside the prison, the temperature had dipped appreciably to single digits celsius. An icy wind was howling about the island - a byproduct of the freezing cold ocean no doubt - and the city of San Francisco had come alive with lights. I stayed outside as long as I could manage, taking several long-exposure shots of the city and the Golden Gate Bridge.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC08935.JPG"&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;That weird streak of light at centre left is a ferry moving during the long exposure&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC08941.JPG"&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The Golden Gate Bridge in the distance&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coming back inside, I wandered through the old prison dining hall. In here was an interesting display on the way that former prisoners rebuild their lives upon their release. The exhibition highlighted five or six particular individuals who had been incarcerated and released, and were now working with underprivileged youths in the local area to prevent them from falling into the same traps. I thought it was a very brave thing for these people to step forward in this way, as well as offer much of their time to helping others avoid the prison system. Back in the main cell block opposite was a demonstration of the prison door locking mechanism - the distinctive screech of metal on metal before a resounding, demoralising thud of the locking doors. Apparently, many a Hollywood film has used the sound of Alcatraz's closing cell doors (including &lt;em&gt;The Empire Strikes Back&lt;/em&gt;), making the island both inspiration for and a tool of the magic of cinema.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC08955.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so my trip to Alcatraz was brought to an end - while day tours to the island have a steady stream of return ferries to the mainland, the night tour has just one. It was an excellent place to visit and explore, capturing a slice of criminal side of America through the twentieth century. The views of the Bay are stunning, and the history of the Rock is a captivating one to follow. &lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Alcatraz"></category><category term="San Francisco"></category><category term="USA"></category><category term="Travel"></category></entry><entry><title>Skiing at Lake Tahoe</title><link href="http://dominickng.com/blog/2013/03/skiing-at-lake-tahoe/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2013-03-30T00:00:00+11:00</updated><author><name>Dominick Ng</name></author><id>tag:dominickng.com,2013-03-30:blog/2013/03/skiing-at-lake-tahoe/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Just three hours northwest of the Bay Area, in the Sierra Nevada, lies Lake Tahoe. Nestled on the border between California and Nevada, Tahoe is one of the largest freshwater lakes in the world. It is highly renowned in California for its skiing in winter and pleasant vacationing in summer. It is the ski destination of choice for many in the Bay Area.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/IMG_0576.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The view out of our front door in Truckee&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soon after my return to Berkeley from the Christmas holiday, a friend mentioned that a small group was heading up to Tahoe to ski at the Northstar resort over a weekend. He kindly invited me along, and so indeed I did. Another friend generously lent me his waterproof pants and ski jacket, whilst I organised to rent skis, ski boots, and a helmet at the ski resort.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/IMG_0578.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Downtown Truckee at 7:30 in the morning, just during breakfast.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We stayed in a little town called Truckee (such an American town name!) on the north side of Lake Tahoe. Reportedly the 5th snowiest town in the US, Truckee was blanketed with white when we pulled in on a Friday afternoon, and our rented condo was surrounded by deep snowfalls. There's something about snow that entices Australians. Maybe because it's such a foreign concept to many of us. The last time I went skiing was eight years ago; on my school's annual ski trip for students in Year 11. Since the school was located deep in country New South Wales, it was an eleven hour bus trip to reach the Australian ski fields, situated in the aptly named Snowy Mountains southwest of Sydney and Canberra. We spent four days on the slopes at Thredbo, and by the end I was competently skiing on intermediate (blue) level runs. But, as Australia is quite a warm country, snow falls can vary greatly. The official ski season is a relatively short 3-4 months (from June to October each year). In contrast, the Tahoe resorts stay open for closer to six months (November to April, and sometimes May), and most lie at a much higher elevation than Australian resorts. I was quite excited to get to see snow again - and to see it in a more acceptable location.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC00171.JPG"&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The road to Northstar resort from Truckee&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We skied at the Northstar ski resort, just ten minutes out of Truckee. I had booked a lesson on the first day at 10:30 to refresh my ski legs. As the ski lifts were open from 8am to 4pm, we were aiming to get there as early as possible - particularly since three of us had to pickup our pre-ordered rental gear, and also to get some practice in before the lesson. Unfortunately, some navigational errors (thanks Apple Maps) took us down the wrong drive at Northstar, so we ended up being slightly late on the first morning. This was compounded by the long lines for gear rental, so we only hit the mountain right as the lesson was due to start. Already, the fields were packed, and lines were starting to form for the chair lifts up the mountain.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/IMG_0574.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lesson took place on the easiest slope at the resort, and thankfully, I soon found that skiing was a little like riding a bike. First, we went through the basics of snow-ploughing ("wedging" in American parlance), where you ski with the front of yours skis turned towards one another to control your forward momentum. As your skis are at an angle to the snow, they "grip" and increase the friction, slowing you down. It's the simplest skiing technique, and the one most associated with amateur skiers since it's very easy to keep yourself from accelerating. Once we had (re-)mastered this, we moved onto the bread and butter of advanced skiing - the parallel turn. This move is where you keep your skis parallel to one another, rather than turned in. There's less friction, so you move faster, and the turn itself is what keeps you from accelerating down the mountain too quickly. I managed to get back to parallel turning later that first afternoon, and was back happily skiing the easy (green) runs after the lesson. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC00195.JPG"&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Lake Tahoe&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After lunch on the first day, we stepped it up slightly, tackling blue (intermediate) runs. The first one we tried was much too steep for my liking (it was aptly titled "Drop Off"). The thing with steeper slopes is that you accelerate faster in your parallel turns, and it's more difficult to complete the turn to bring your speed under control. I managed to make it down intact, and we ratcheted down the difficulty a little, tackling easier blue runs to build confidence to end the day. After a very early breakfast at a diner in Truckee, the second day was spent skiing almost essentially nonstop. We took several runs from the very top of the mountain at Northstar, which was blessed with a truly spectacular view of Lake Tahoe - deep blue, unfrozen despite the chill, and simply beautiful in the sunshine. Whilst there were some steep sections of runs that I wasn't much a fan of, I didn't fall over very often, and thoroughly enjoyed the more challenging runs. We managed to be on one of the last lifts up to the top of the mountain on both days, skiing all the way back down to the bottom is relatively peace and quiet as the slopes emptied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC00201.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tahoe is an amazing place to ski. It's absolutely beautiful with excellent snow. I had a fantastic time, and came back glad that my ski legs had returned so quickly despite the years. I'll definitely make sure that my next skiing trip isn't as long after the last as this one was.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Skiing"></category><category term="Lake Tahoe"></category><category term="California"></category><category term="USA"></category></entry><entry><title>The San Francisco Valentine's Day Pillow Fight</title><link href="http://dominickng.com/blog/2013/03/the-san-francisco-valentines-day-pillow/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2013-03-11T00:00:00+11:00</updated><author><name>Dominick Ng</name></author><id>tag:dominickng.com,2013-03-11:blog/2013/03/the-san-francisco-valentines-day-pillow/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I don't much like Valentine's Day. But it seems like San Francisco agrees with me, because February 14th in the city features an enormous pillow fight at Justin Herman Plaza, opposite the Ferry Building near Embarcadero. 2013 was the eighth annual incarnation of the event, where hundreds of people gather to hit on strangers with things other than bad pick-up lines.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC00241.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fight was due to start at six o'clock sharp, so we left Berkeley clutching our pillows at 5pm (yes, it takes that long to get to San Francisco from Berkeley, even though you can see the city just over the Bay). It was entertaining playing "spot the fellow pillow fighters" on the train; we would exchange sheepish nods in acknowledgement of the shared hilarity of the situation. By the time we passed Oakland and entered the TransBay tunnel, several other people had gotten into the carriage with pillows. We stood out even amongst these because one of our party was in the process of fashioning pillow armour: taping pillows to his arms and legs.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC00271.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We made it to the plaza just in time, and were faced with the hilarious sight of hundreds of people milling around with pillows at the ready. Some had come prepared with face masks, scarves, and ski goggles, whilst others had come in costumes. We spotted Captain America and a cow in amongst the crowd.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC00247.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Six o'clock came and the pillows began flying. Hundreds of complete strangers, indiscriminately swinging their fluffy weapons of war at each other and laughing all the while. Many people had unwisely brought feather pillows rather than synthetic ones; the feathered variety would burst quickly and spray their contents all over people and the plaza. Soon, the tiled ground resembled a winter wonderland, and the air was full of white. It was hard to avoid swallowing the flying fluff; I think I was still coughing up feathers later that evening, and picking them out of my shoes and clothes.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC00273.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sun set and the night lights came on. The field of war lapsed into darkness, and the attacks became even more random. People waded through the crowd, swinging their pillows at anyone or anything in their path. Surprisingly enough, some of the roughest participants were tiny little children, dressed in caps and hoods, screaming at the tops of their lungs as they sprinted through legs, thwacking at will. Some people with evident anger management issues were in the crowd; some strikes were definitely more venomous than others. But the vast majority of people were taking the event in the right spirit: swinging with some force, but always with a smile on their face.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC00275.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Purportedly, the event cost the San Francisco Department of Public Works $5000 to &lt;a href="http://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/weird/Great-San-Francisco-Pillow-Fight-Tab-Is-5K-191485561.html"&gt;clean up&lt;/a&gt; (an affair that mostly involves hoovering up feathers and picking up discarded pillow carcasses). Thankfully, they don't seem too miffed at the deliberate mess, saying that the event is becoming a regular part of the San Francisco Valentine's Day experience. I can certainly say that it's the strangest, yet most entertaining experience I've had on February 14th. &lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Valentine's Day"></category><category term="San Francisco"></category><category term="USA"></category></entry><entry><title>Air Trip (V): Pearl Harbour and Downtown Honolulu</title><link href="http://dominickng.com/blog/2013/02/air-trip-v-pearl-harbour-and-downtown/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2013-02-28T00:00:00+11:00</updated><author><name>Dominick Ng</name></author><id>tag:dominickng.com,2013-02-28:blog/2013/02/air-trip-v-pearl-harbour-and-downtown/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This is part V of a series on my trip home to Australia for the US winter break (see &lt;a href="http://blog.dominickng.com/2013/01/road-trip-i-highway-1-monterey-pebble.html"&gt;part I&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://blog.dominickng.com/2013/02/road-trip-ii-santa-barbara-and-malibu.html"&gt;part II&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://blog.dominickng.com/2013/02/road-trip-iii-los-angeles-santa-monica.html"&gt;part III&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://blog.dominickng.com/2013/02/air-trip-iv-hawaii-honolulu-and-waikiki.html"&gt;part IV&lt;/a&gt;).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;December 7th, 1941. A day that will live in infamy. Up until that date, the US had been content to sit on the sidelines of World War II, and clandestinely supply the Allied Forces. Peace negotiations with Japan had stalled; Japan refused to give up the territories it had amassed or the ambitions it harboured, and so the US embargoed its oil exports to the Asian nation - some 80% of Japan's consumption. Something clearly had to give. The Japanese fleet would soon run out of the oil needed to fuel its march across Asia. The threat of the United States had to be eliminated - specifically, its carrier fleet in the Pacific.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC08092.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A surprise attack would be launched on the US naval base at Pearl Harbour, home of the Pacific Fleet. The Japanese carrier fleet sailed under top secrecy, dodging the outer US patrols, and positioned itself for the most audacious assault in modern warfare. Over three hundred planes were launched towards the US base, a mass so large that the US radar operators on the north of O'ahu did not realise what they were looking at. At 7:48am local time, the attack began. Within hours, 18 ships, including five giant battleships, had been sunk or run aground. Over 2000 American fatalities and 1000 wounded for the loss of less than 100 Japanese troops and 30 aircraft. The theatre of battle had shifted, and the Pacific War had begun.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC08123.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, Pearl Harbour is one of the most sobering sites that I have ever visited. A moving memorial to the American and Japanese forces who lost their lives in the name of conquest on December 7th, 1941, it is a must-see for any visit to Honolulu. There are several different sites located at the Harbour, including the &lt;em&gt;USS Arizona&lt;/em&gt; Memorial, the battleship &lt;em&gt;USS Missouri&lt;/em&gt;, the submarine &lt;em&gt;Blowfin&lt;/em&gt;, and the Pacific Aviation Museum, and covering them can take up the better part of a whole day. Located just to the west of the city, it is accessible both by municipal buses, and private shuttle services directly from your hotel. The shuttles are relatively inexpensive, so I opted to book a shuttle service to leave my hostel at 7am in the morning, aiming to arrive at Pearl Harbour by 8am.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC08101.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;USS Arizona&lt;/em&gt; was one of the battleships moored at Battleship Row on the morning of the fateful attack. Struck by several bombs in the assault, the Arizona's forward magazines spectacularly exploded, breaking the back of the ship and instantly killing over a thousand sailors. The ship burned for more than two days, surrounded by further scenes of devastation as the US armed forces struggled to recover. Today, the white &lt;em&gt;USS Arizona&lt;/em&gt; memorial straddles the hull of the ship that still sits at the bottom of the harbour, the final resting place of thousands.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC08126.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Naval ferries carry people from the shore to the memorial and back again. Entry is free, but tickets are given away on a first-come first-served basis at the Pearl Harbour ticket office (though they can be reserved for small fee online if you're organised well in advance). Typically, all tickets have disappeared by midday; my 8am arrival led to a ticket for entry at 9am. You can also purchase tickets for all of the other Pearl Harbour sites at the ticket office; there are small discounts for packaging two or more of them together, and shuttle buses connect each of the sites. A word of warning: you will have to check bags for a small fee before entering the Pearl Harbour complex; bottles of water are allowed, as well as plastic bags and women's purses, but any other bags must be left outside. Come prepared - pack lightly, or ready to check.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC08091.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having a spare hour prior to your ticketed entry time is perfect for checking out the free museum adjacent to the ticket office. It gives an excellent introduction to the background of the Pacific War, with interactive displays, beautiful models of warships and planes, and moving tributes to the courage shown by servicemen and women on that day. Particularly interesting is the description of the Japanese preparations for the attack. Meticulous intelligence from spies and scouts was gathered. New dive bombing techniques (skimming low and fast over the water) as well as specially designed torpedoes that could operate in the relatively shallow Pearl Harbour were developed. But unfortunately for the Japanese, their true targets - the American carriers &lt;em&gt;USS Lexington&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Enterprise, _and _Saratoga&lt;/em&gt; - were not present at the time of the attack. These carriers, as well as the hastily transferred &lt;em&gt;USS Yorktown _and _Hornet&lt;/em&gt;, were critical in swinging the course of the Pacific War back to the United States through the Battle of the Coral Sea and the decisive Battle of Midway. World War II marked the end of the era of the heavily armoured battleship, and launched the naval dominance of the fleet carrier - a dominance that continues today.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC08166.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A visit to the &lt;em&gt;Arizona&lt;/em&gt; memorial begins with an excellent short film that reminds the visitor of the site's status as a grave for thousands of sailors. You then proceed to the naval ferry that carries you across Pearl Harbour to the memorial itself, floating white above the rusting hulk of the &lt;em&gt;Arizona&lt;/em&gt;. Still leaking oil into the harbour (the "Black Tears of the &lt;em&gt;Arizona&lt;/em&gt;"), the ship is a sombre symbol of tragedy. The terror of being fried alive as the ship exploded is hardly imaginable. Within the memorial are lists of the sailors who perished, as well as the ashes of survivors who have chosen to be interred with their former compatriots. People from all over the world - no matter their allegiance in the war - come here to pay their respects, and all are welcome to do so. I thought that the even-handed depiction of the attack on Pearl Harbour and its aftermath was one of the unsung triumphs of the site.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC08140.JPG"&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The Black Tears of the _Arizona_&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moored just next to the &lt;em&gt;Arizona&lt;/em&gt; is the battleship &lt;em&gt;USS Missouri&lt;/em&gt; - the "Mighty Mo". It was upon this ship that the instrument of Japan's surrender was signed in 1945 in Tokyo Bay, bringing to an end six years of bloody warfare. Touring it is an amazing trip onto another world - from the massive deck guns to the cramped belowships and scrubbed teak decks. (An aside - I learnt that teak is weather-resistant, corrosion resistant, durable, nonslip when wet, and doesn't shrink - prized qualities for boatbuilding!).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC08110.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, the ship is no longer staffed by a full naval complement. Instead, a multitude of extremely knowledgeable tour guides wander the decks, happily dispensing stories and histories of the ship's operational life and its role in the war. I learnt that each American battleship is named after a state; the &lt;em&gt;Missouri&lt;/em&gt; was the third ship to carry that name, and she was the last battleship completed by the US. Her most recent naval engagement was as fire support during Operation Desert Storm in the early 1990s. And just visible in the above photo is a patch of white on the side of the ship; this marks the impact site of a kamikaze pilot who crashed into the ship in 1945.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC08191.JPG"&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;This struck me as being a very American image&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC08210.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much of the battleship is accessible when you visit, with the exception of the furthest belowdecks sections such as the engine rooms and shell magazines. You can climb all the way up to the bridge for a spectacular view over the massive forward guns towards the &lt;em&gt;Arizona&lt;/em&gt; memorial. You can also explore the cramped living quarters, mess halls, and working areas of the ship's interior, including sleeping bunks, an industrial-sized kitchen, offices, workshops, the officer's lounge and quarters.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC08249.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I learnt some amusing anecdotes about the signing of the Instrument of Surrender. Firstly, the British had commissioned a beautiful wooden table to be used for the signing ceremony; but at the last minute, it was discovered that the table was too small to fit the documents. A set of fold-up tables were hastily acquired from the mess hall, and covered with tablecloths to obscure their utilitarian origins. Secondly, the great US Fleet Admiral Chester Nimitz, commander of the Pacific Fleet, was delegated to sign the Instrument on behalf of the United States. However, General Douglas MacArthur, the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers, did not intend to be left out of the signing process, and managed to secure a place for his signature, with his title as Supreme Commander. All of the other Allied signatories were country representatives, which tells you a little about MacArthur's personality. And finally, there were two copies of the Instrument; one for Japan, and one for the Allied forces. Both are on display on the Missouri; but on the Japanese copy, the Canadian representative (Colonel Lawrence Cosgrave) accidentally signed below his line instead of on it, causing everyone following him to also sign in the incorrect location. When the error was noticed, the preprinted titles were hurriedly crossed out and rewritten by hand to match the locations of the signatures.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC08219.JPG"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Pacific Aviation Museum sits in two enormous hangers on Ford Island, near the Mighty Mo. Filled with all manner of planes dating from World War II up until today, the museum is a fascinating catalogue of aerial warfare through the ages. The collection includes the Mitsubishi Zero fighters that dive-bombed Pearl Harbour, Russian MiGs, Sea King helicopters, and modern F-14s and F-15s. The museum is particularly interesting as it covers much of the period after the Pearl Harbour attack and up to modern times. It recounts the ultimately successful US Pacific War campaign through the Battles of the Coral Sea and Midway, the changing face of aerial warfare in Vietnam, and operations in modern times.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC08288.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One attack remembered in the museum was the Doolittle Raid, which took place four months after the attack on Pearl Harbour. 16 long-range bombers were launched from the_ USS Hornet_ to attack Japan in retaliation for Pearl Harbour. Planned and led by Lieutenant James Doolittle, the raiders were to attack military targets in Tokyo, before proceeding to land in friendly China. Unfortunately, the &lt;em&gt;Hornet&lt;/em&gt; was spotted by a patrol craft whilst 300km further from the Japanese coast than planned, and the element of surprise was lost. The decision was made to launch the mission immediately, and the bombers took off, rocketing towards the island country. They succeeded in reaching and bombing their targets, and proceeded to escape towards China and the Soviet Union. Unfortunately, the early launch meant that the raiders were critically low on fuel, and so each one was forced to crash land or bail out along the Chinese coast before reaching their intended air bases. The majority of the crews were able to escape Japanese retaliation thanks to the help of Chinese airmen and civilians. But sadly, the Chinese paid dearly; Japanese forces killed an estimated 250,000 civilians whilst searching for the raiders, tearing airfields apart and using germ warfare.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The raid itself did little damage to the intended targets, but the direct military strike substantially boosted the morale of the American public and armed forces. In the eyes of the Japanese military, it seemed apparent that the home islands were vulnerable to air attack. The Indian ocean carrier force was recalled to defend the homeland, and the attack influenced the decision to target the Midway atoll northwest of Pearl Harbour - the site of the critical and decisive defeat of the Japanese fleet in the Battle of Midway.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC08283.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One final anecdote from the Aviation Museum tells the story of how Commander Joseph Rochefort and his cryptanalysis team in Hawaii managed to break the Japanese JN-25 cipher, revealing plans to attack a mysterious target "AF". Rochefort suspected that AF referred to Midway, and one of his officers hatched a brilliant plan to test the hypothesis. They suggested that Midway send out an unencrypted message advising a water supply failure in hopes of provoking a Japanese response. The bait was taken; the Japanese broadcast instructions to load more water desalination equipment, confirming the analysis. The broadcasts also revealed that the attack was to come before mid-June, giving the Americans a substantial intelligence advantage for the Battle of Midway.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC08296.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moored just near the Pearl Harbour ticket office on the mainland is the submarine &lt;em&gt;USS Blowfin&lt;/em&gt;, which can be entered for another fee. I chose to not tour the submarine, having been aboard one before (the &lt;em&gt;HMAS Vampire&lt;/em&gt;, moored in Darling Harbour in Sydney). By now I was feeling a little military fatigue, so I elected to return to Honolulu for my final few hours in Hawaii.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC08323.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hawaii has quite a storied history. In the late 1700s, warring tribes and chiefs fought each other for power, until the islands were conquered by King Kamehameha I ("Kamehameha the Great") in the early 1800s. This formally established the Kingdom of Hawaii as an independent state, and alliances with its Pacific neighbours kept it that way. Kamehameha is remembered by several statues dotted across Hawaii; the one above stands opposite the Iolani Palace in downtown Honolulu. There's a funny story about this statue; it's actually a replacement. The original was cast in Europe, but while en route to Hawaii its ship sank off the Falkland Islands following a storm and a fire. The insurance funds from the loss of the statue were used to commission a new one (the one in the picture), but in the meantime, fisherman in the Falklands recovered the original statue, which was recovered by a British sea captain and then sold to the Hawaiian government. The original statue (in worse shape than its replacement) was placed near Kamehameha's birthplace on the Big Island.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fun fact: the first contact between the inhabitants of Hawaii and Europeans was from the landing of none other than Captain James Cook in 1778. Captain Cook is the British explorer famed Down Under as the man who discovered Australia in 1770. Unfortunately, Hawaii was also where Captain Cook was killed after returning to the Big Island for repairs to his ship's mast in 1779. A fight broke out between his crew and the native Hawaiians, resulting in Cook being felled by a blow to the head, and killed by stab wounds as he lay in the surf.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC08327.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Opposite the Kamehameha statue is the Iolani Palace - the only royal palace on US soil. It was the official residence of the monarch of Hawaii, prior to the overthrow of the monarchy and establishment of a republic in 1893. After the overthrow, the palace was used as the provisional capital building for over 70 years. Nowadays the more modern capitol buildings sit just behind it to the north east, and the palace is open as a museum to the public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My last night in Waikiki was spent watching hula dancers in an international food court near my hostel, and catching up with a friend from Berkeley who had just arrived to Honolulu (though with many, many delays due to freezing cold conditions at San Francisco). Finally, I left Waikiki early in the morning for the last leg of my journey: the ten hour flight back home to Sydney, Australia. In a week I had covered a substantial amount of ground - possibly too much. But now I know the places to get and see again, and sometime in the future I'll be back to see those sights that I missed the first time round. The US is such a diverse country, full of interesting people and things to see. And there's still so much more. &lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Pearl Harbor"></category><category term="Hawaii"></category><category term="Travel"></category><category term="USA"></category></entry><entry><title>Air Trip (IV): Hawaii, Honolulu and Waikiki</title><link href="http://dominickng.com/blog/2013/02/air-trip-iv-hawaii-honolulu-and-waikiki/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2013-02-21T00:00:00+11:00</updated><author><name>Dominick Ng</name></author><id>tag:dominickng.com,2013-02-21:blog/2013/02/air-trip-iv-hawaii-honolulu-and-waikiki/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This is part IV of a series on my trip home to Australia for the US winter break (see &lt;a href="http://blog.dominickng.com/2013/01/road-trip-i-highway-1-monterey-pebble.html"&gt;part I&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://blog.dominickng.com/2013/02/road-trip-ii-santa-barbara-and-malibu.html"&gt;part II&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://blog.dominickng.com/2013/02/road-trip-iii-los-angeles-santa-monica.html"&gt;part III&lt;/a&gt;).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hawaii is one of the two non-contiguous US states (the other being Alaska), and consists of a series of islands floating in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. O'ahu is the major island, though it not the largest; that honour belongs to the aptly titled Big Island. O'ahu houses the state capital of Honolulu (which is the inbound port of call for much of Hawaii's sea freight) and has a long history of military importance; Pearl Harbour is just to the west of Honolulu, and several army and air force bases continue to operate on the island. The current US President, Barack Obama, was born in Hawaii, and spent his early childhood attending one of the most exclusive private schools in Honolulu. Whilst the other islands are popular tourist attractions in their own right, I spent my (brief) stay on O'ahu.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC07988.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I left Los Angeles on a cold December morning. We were away and out of the hostel before 7am, beating most of the morning traffic, and made it to LAX airport well on time. Unfortunately, it took my companion more than twice as long to drive back to the hostel - a sign of just how bad traffic gets in the city. It was my first trip through LAX, and I didn't find it as bad as many people had made it out to be - though that impression may change once I need to spend a lengthy layover there.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC08007.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Honolulu International Airport is roughly 5 hours flight time from LAX, and I flew on Hawaiian Airlines to get there. So far, Hawaiian is the most comfortable US airline I've flown by a country mile: I took them from California to Hawaii, onto Sydney, and then for the return trip as well. The California-Hawaii leg featured a free (though no-nonsense) meal - a rarity for US domestic flights - and since my itinerary included an international component, I didn't have to pay any fees to check my baggage. There was sufficient legroom in my seats, and I even ended up with several empty seats around me on my return journey to the US. I can very much recommend Hawaiian as a relatively comfortable method of flying (as well as inexpensive; my round trip home was cheaper than the round trip to the States that I booked initially).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC08013.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prior to arriving in Hawaii I booked a shuttle service (&lt;a href="http://www.robertshawaii.com/"&gt;Roberts Hawaii&lt;/a&gt;) to pick me up from the airport and take me on the roughly 45 minute trip to my hostel in Waikiki. I can recommend Roberts very highly; they meet you at the flight gate with a shell lei (I was too cheap to pay extra for a flower one, though that is another option), help you with your luggage, and escort you onto a comfortable bus for the trip. Of course, I ran into a couple on their honeymoon as soon as I stepped onto the bus, and saw several more over the course of my stay. Our driver, a friendly gentleman named Bradford, gave us a running commentary on sights and landmarks as we drove through the south of Honolulu and into Waikiki. (Pictured above is the Ala Moana Center - the world's largest open-air shopping mall - that we passed along the way.) Unfortunately, as we were driving in along the Nimitz Freeway, it began raining. The rain would continue in fits and spurts - sometimes heavy, sometimes light, sometimes not present - for the entirety of my trip, an unfortunate reminder that I had arrived in Hawaii during rainy season.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC07993.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I stayed in Waikiki, located to the south of Honolulu, in a hostel just minutes walk from the famous beach. About the first thing I did when I arrived was taking advantage of some momentary sunshine and enjoying a dip. It was simply wonderful to be warm again - despite the rain, the temperature was a relatively balmy 25 degrees, and the water was similarly temperate. Waikiki Beach is famous for having extremely flat waves - the kind that are perfect for learning to surf on, but can't even propel bodysurfers forward. It's next to impossible to get dumped by a wave here, and scores of people were out learning how to surf. Being used to the deep blue ocean of Australia's beaches, I was mesmerised by the lovely light blue colour of the water here. The one slightly annoying aspect of the beach was the multitude of sharp coral that dotted the ocean floor; this made wading in and out a little painful.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC07989.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tim Tams are a chocolate-covered biscuit prevalent in Australia but difficult to find elsewhere in the world. At home, packets typically cost $2-3. I found these on display in a convenience store in Waikiki - authentic, but quite the rip off!  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC07998.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Waikiki is very touristy. The area is covered with hotels, expensive (and inexpensive) shopping, uniformly expensive food, bars, clubs, and a hopping nightlife. I spent the rest of my first afternoon wandering around the district, eventually making my way towards Downtown Honolulu to the west. The famous Aloha Tower sits at the south edge of the city, overlooking the harbour, serving as a welcoming beacon to ships entering the Honolulu port. Built in 1926, it was the tallest building in Hawaii for forty years even though it stands at just ten stories tall. Just to its north is the Chinatown district, where I ate a very tasty Vietnamese dinner.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC08033.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I made my way home from dinner, I passed the City Council building, which was spectacularly lit for Christmas. The park surrounding it was full of Christmas decorations, and families were out in force. I spent an hour wandering around the displays and enjoying the lights. It truly is a special holiday for the young.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC08046.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The park was full of children. There was a Christmas train, merry-go-rounds, face-painting, balloons, and Christmas trees galore. Trees and buildings were spectacularly lit up, whilst all manner of displays dotted the area.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC08073.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The front of the city council building was dominated by this eminently appropriate statue of Santa enjoying the warmth of Hawaii, complete with a floating turtle coaster and Mrs Clause by his side.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC08086.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within the building, several different public departments (including the firemen, the commerce committee, and the teachers) had constructed Christmas displays, all themed appropriately. A real life Santa was posing for pictures with children (thankfully better clothed than the version outside), and a long, long line snaked around the floor from him.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC08087.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My night finished with some hot malasadas from a mobile outpost of Leonard's Bakery, a local institution. Malasadas are a kind of delicious Portuguese doughnut, and they come with a variety of very tasty fillings. I highly recommend them (though not too many of them!) if you have the chance. I took a relatively early nightcap because I had a trip to Pearl Harbour the next morning. I'll leave that story for next time. &lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Hawaii"></category><category term="Waikiki"></category><category term="Travel"></category><category term="USA"></category></entry><entry><title>Road Trip (III): Los Angeles, Santa Monica, UCLA, and the Hollywood</title><link href="http://dominickng.com/blog/2013/02/road-trip-iii-los-angeles-santa-monica/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2013-02-16T00:00:00+11:00</updated><author><name>Dominick Ng</name></author><id>tag:dominickng.com,2013-02-16:blog/2013/02/road-trip-iii-los-angeles-santa-monica/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This is part III of a series on my trip home to Australia for the US winter break (see &lt;a href="http://blog.dominickng.com/2013/01/road-trip-i-highway-1-monterey-pebble.html"&gt;part I&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://blog.dominickng.com/2013/02/road-trip-ii-santa-barbara-and-malibu.html"&gt;part II&lt;/a&gt;).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC07984.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Los Angeles is a monstrously large place. The metro area is home to nearly 13 million people, and the city itself is second only to New York in population. Not only this, but LA has bulged out over a truly enormous area; until arriving there, I had not fully appreciated why it might be so difficult to get around without a car. The truth is, the city is spread out over such a large area that all of the interesting attractions are spaced very far apart. Public transportation exists, but in its current state, it cannot possibly hope to cover the entire city in a convenient fashion. If and when you visit Los Angeles, make sure you have your own form of motorized transportation. It will save you a lot of wasted time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC07963.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We arrived in the city early in the afternoon, and proceeded to stash our gear at our hostel in Santa Monica. Technically, Santa Monica is a city independent of Los Angeles, but the difference is truly academic as the city is surrounded on three sides by LA. LAX airport is also just southwest of Santa Monica, making it an easy to reach destination for the recently arrived. Santa Monica sits right on the Pacific coastline, with spectacular beaches extending down most of its length. It is the terminus of the legendary Route 66 (or what remains of it), and renowned as a shopping and holiday destination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/IMG_17.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I only had one day in Los Angeles before flying to Hawaii, so our schedule was quite packed. We immediately departed the hostel to make our way to UCLA, Berkeley's sister campus. We drove there via the famous Sunset Boulevard, which stretches from the Pacific Coast Highway just north of Santa Monica right into downtown Los Angeles. The Boulevard is a twisty, sometimes treacherous, often congested road that carries you past many symbols of the glamour of Hollywood - guitar stores, nightlife, recording studios, radio stations, and more. The palm trees that line the Boulevard add to the Hollywood feeling - though the large branches that they shed onto the road made for even more things to dodge on the drive!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC07839.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UCLA was established as the second campus of the University of California system, and today it is the second flagship campus along with Berkeley (Funnily enough, "California" or "Cal" in a university context is almost unambiguously referring to Berkeley; UCLA uses its four letter acronym exclusively). It has 40,000 students, making it the largest university by enrolment in California, but despite this, the grounds are relatively small, nestled just south of Sunset Boulevard in the west LA neighbourhood of Westwood. A neat bit of trivia - athletes from the university have won a gold medal in every single Olympic Games that the US has participated in since 1932. Not a bad streak!  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC07865.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite being the second smallest of the UCs in terms of area, the campus is spacious and stunningly beautiful. The buildings are simply amazing when bathed in the afternoon sunshine - the kind of pristine yellow light that doesn't seem to exist in the Bay Area. We found some free parking and spent an hour just walking around admiring the campus. California does have some truly amazing universities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC07867.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our next destination was a vantage point for the famous Hollywood sign. The sign is nestled in the Hollywood Hills, north of Hollywood and Los Angeles on Mount Lee, the tallest peak in the area. Each letter is 14 metres tall and made out of steel (though the original letters were made of wood, being designed to last only a year and a half. The sign deteriorated severely, before the wooden letters were replaced in 1978).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC07873.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following some &lt;a href="http://www.pachd.com/free-images/hollywood-sign.html"&gt;handy instructions&lt;/a&gt; from the internet, we were heading for 3000 Canyon Lake Drive. It was a race against time and traffic - we thought that we had easily beaten rush hour, but this was definitely not the case, and we got stuck for fifteen minutes at an intersection with the infamously slow Highway 101. We barely crawled along for a substantial period of time as the sun continued to set, until finally we managed to compute a different route and duck out of the jam. The route was very twisty, leading us up into the sparsely populated Hollywood Hills, around the Hollywood water reservoir, and along skinny one-way streets. Of course, the GPS eventually led us to a dead-end road (damn you GPS), but a few different turns later and we were back in motion, making it to Canyon Lake Drive just in the nick of time before sunset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC07880.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The online advice proved to be extremely good. There's park at 3000 Canyon Lake Drive where cars can be left for free. A fifteen minute walk up the hill then brought us to an amazing vantage point for the sign. Many, many pictures were taken until the light faded and we were left in darkness. And as a reminder of how enormous Los Angeles is, the city and ocean were clearly visible from the park as we left - distantly glittering as the sun went down.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC_0867.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We departed Canyon Lake Drive with the intention of making our way to Griffith Park Observatory. The Observatory promised to be another excellent vantage point for the Hollywood sign, as well as providing ample stargazing opportunities. Our route would take us through more twisty roads in the Hollywood Hills, over the top of the mountain and down the other side. Unfortunately, we eventually hit another dead end - though this one was artificial. A steel gate barred our progress, with the requisite explanatory sign curtly informing us that local residents were being consulted over the passage of traffic along the road, and for the time being, the road was closed. With no other way over the mountain (except to descent and reascend, which would take prohibitively long), we chose to return to Santa Monica and pursue other evening activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC07971.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That evening, we headed out for an evening walk around Santa Monica. Now, I was expecting LA to be warmer than our previous destinations. However, we seemed to have chosen just the week where LA turned cold. There was a icy, howling wind blowing in off the Pacific Ocean, rendering extremities next to useless. Braving the chill, we made our way towards the pier, walking past a brightly lit but deserted (and closed) amusement park, and numerous closed restaurants and shops. At the pier's end, we were witness to a marriage proposal; a crowd of about 15 people had gathered with balloons, screaming excitedly at the bridge's acceptance. It was loud enough to attract a police car, which pulled in to investigate the commotion. Unfortunately, there wasn't much else happening on the famous pier; the cold and night seemed to have scared off other comers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC07951.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This brought to a close my brief visit to Los Angeles and my road trip south. It featured nearly 1000km of driving and six days of touristing along some of the nicest coastlines in the world. The next morning, I cleared out of the hostel early, making my way to LAX airport and a flight to Hawaii. More on that in the next post.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Los Angeles"></category><category term="Santa Monica"></category><category term="Highway 1"></category><category term="Pacfic Coast"></category><category term="USA"></category><category term="California"></category><category term="Road Trip"></category></entry><entry><title>Road Trip (II): Santa Barbara and Malibu</title><link href="http://dominickng.com/blog/2013/02/road-trip-ii-santa-barbara-and-malibu/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2013-02-03T00:00:00+11:00</updated><author><name>Dominick Ng</name></author><id>tag:dominickng.com,2013-02-03:blog/2013/02/road-trip-ii-santa-barbara-and-malibu/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This is part II of a series on my trip home to Australia for the US winter break (see part I &lt;a href="http://blog.dominickng.com/2013/01/road-trip-i-highway-1-monterey-pebble.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Santa Barbara is a city of close to 90,000 people just a couple of hours north of Los Angeles. The area is known as the "American Riviera", partially thanks to its pleasant climate. The city draws heavy influence from Spain, with its original inhabitants being Spanish missionaries and soldiers, and even today much of the architecture is Spanish Colonial Revival in style. It did not become a part of the United States until the mid 1800s, after which its growth was driven rapidly by expanding transport links and the discovery of offshore oil. The city also has the distinction of being the first US mainland target fired upon in over a century when a Japanese submarine surfaced off the coast in 1942 and fired at the offshore oil rigs.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC07742.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We pulled into Santa Barbara in the evening, and following a tasty Thai dinner, we headed to bed tired after a long day on the road. The next morning, we went to the Santa Barbara County Courthouse, recommended for the views of the city from the clock tower and sometimes described as one of the most beautiful public buildings in the United States. The advice certainly did not disappoint. The rain held off in the morning, and we caught Santa Barbara in a rare moment of sunshine (at least for this trip). The city is very flat, such that the five story high courthouse was sufficiently tall to grant an excellent view.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC07745.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC07748.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most notable holdovers from the Spanish era of the city is the Mission Santa Barbara. Founded by the Franciscan order, the Mission was destroyed by an earthquake in 1812, and further damaged by a 1925 earthquake. It was rebuilt and restored following each disaster, with the interior going almost unmodified from the 1820s till today. It remains an active place of worship, with tourists being charged to enter the rest of the historic site.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC07774.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a seaside city, the Stearns Wharf is another popular tourist attraction in Santa Barbara. Featuring the requisite overpriced seafood restaurants, the wharf juts out into the Pacific Ocean, granting lovely views of the distant oil rigs and ships. Sadly, by the time we made it to the wharf, the clouds had settled over the sun and the day had turned overcast, dampening the mood somewhat.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC07791.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Forgoing the expensive seafood on the pier, we had lunch at a British restaurant back in the town proper, where they served very tasty fish and chips in newspaper, along with mushy peas if you so desired. One of my friends also picked this delicacy for dessert: a deep fried Mars bar smothered in cream and chocolate sauce. Properly unhealthy and disgusting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/IMG_0450.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Santa Barbara is home to another campus of the University of California system. Perched on a cliffside over a beach some 20 minutes out of the city proper, scuttlebutt pins UCSB as being the "party campus" of the UCs. Make of this what you will, but the university is wonderfully spacious and flat (Berkeley's positioning on a steep hill drives me bonkers every single day), and a lovely place to wander around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC07808.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We left Santa Barbara after two days to continue our trip south to Los Angeles. By now, Highway 1 had become the Pacific Coast Highway, and our next stop arrived quickly. Lunchtime saw us roll into Malibu, a "city" of 12,000 people that extends along a 34km stretch of the highway. Famous for its beaches and Hollywood star inhabitants, the city is one of the most affluent in the local area. Strangely enough, most residents of the town live within shouting distance of the highway, making the city very long and very skinny.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC07810.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By now the sun was back out, but the water temperature was quite icy. There were very few people on the beaches and in the water, despite the illusion of sunshine. As it was a weekend, there was also very little open. We were expecting the famous Malibu Pier to be a hive of activity, but it was deserted as well.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC07838.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We ate lunch at the Jack-in-the-Box across the road from the Malibu Pier. Jack-in-the-Box is just another generic American fast-food chain serving burgers and fries. Notably, this marked possibly the first time I had fast food in the United States - California in general is quite big on eating organically and eating healthily, and I couldn't even tell you where you could find fast food in Berkeley. There's just always a better option, and never a worse one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC_0801.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leaving Malibu in the early afternoon, we arrived quickly at what was my last stop of the trip: Los Angeles. There'll be more on that next time. &lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Highway 1"></category><category term="Pacfic Coast"></category><category term="Santa Barbara"></category><category term="Malibu"></category><category term="Travel"></category><category term="California"></category><category term="USA"></category><category term="Road Trip"></category></entry><entry><title>Road Trip (I): Highway 1, Monterey, Pebble Beach, Big Sur</title><link href="http://dominickng.com/blog/2013/01/road-trip-i-highway-1-monterey-pebble/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2013-01-24T00:00:00+11:00</updated><author><name>Dominick Ng</name></author><id>tag:dominickng.com,2013-01-24:blog/2013/01/road-trip-i-highway-1-monterey-pebble/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;My trip back to Australia for the semester break was a long one. Prior to Christmas, I packed into a car with four other international students at Berkeley, and we drove down California Highway 1 from San Francisco to Los Angeles. From LA I flew to Hawaii and visited Honolulu for a couple days, and finally jetted back into Sydney two days before Christmas Day. This is the first installment of a series of blog posts about this great trip.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC07726.JPG"&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The famous Bixby Creek Bridge in the distance, located in the Big Sur region&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Highway 1 snakes down the California coastline, following some of the most beautiful seaside scenery in the US. It starts well north of the Bay Area, near a little town called Leggett in Mendocino County, and continues south for over a thousand kilometres until reaching its terminus in Orange County near Los Angeles. There are a great variety of roads of the route, ranging from modern, fast freeways to meandering roads through small towns and cliffside stretches following twists of the coast - hairpin turn after hairpin turn at less than 60 km/h (or 35 mph). The weather is extremely variable - whilst it rained on most days during the trip (sigh), we would have bursts of brilliant sunshine before plunging into fog and rain.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC07640.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We joined Highway 1 at Pacifica, just south of San Francisco, having crossed the Bay Bridge from Berkeley. Passing Half Moon Bay on the way, our first stop on the trip was Monterey, roughly 3 hours south of San Francisco. Famous for its yearly jazz festival, the sea life in the Monterey Aquarium as well as Monterey Bay, the city featured California's first theatre, public library, public school, and printing press. Today, the 30,000 inhabitants of the city are reminded of their history through attractions such as the historic Cannery Row and Fisherman's Wharf.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC07634.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both the wharf area and Cannery Row are filled with overpriced tourist traps selling all manner of trinkets, tidbits, and tasty things. The harbours are covered with boats of all kinds, as well as these friendly inhabitants above who were catching some of the feeble sun that day. I think the highlight of Monterey for me was our hostel, which featured a large lounge with comfortable couches and even a piano. It had a lovely friendly atmosphere, and was probably the most hospitable place we stopped at.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC07682.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our second day of travel took us from Monterey down to Santa Barbara - approximately six hours of driving, with several hours of stops along the way. Just south of Monterey sits 17 Mile Drive, a famous scenic route through Pebble Beach. Many mansions and pricey golf courses line the road; a portion of the route is actually within a gated residential community, and requires a $9.75 toll to traverse. The full length of the drive is actually 17 miles, but this requires a full loop back to the starting point at Sunset Drive; most people exit before completing the full loop to continue driving south.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC07689.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upon paying the toll, you receive a map pointing out the major attractions along the way. The Drive snakes along the coast and through leafy forests, gently undulating around Pebble Beach. There are many great spots to stop and take photos of the houses, golf courses, and coastline; you're joined in this undertaking by coaches full of tourists and numerous cars of sightseers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC07693.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most famous attraction is the Lone Cypress tree, situated about halfway along the drive. Balanced on an outcrop and framed by mountains and the sea, the tree is striking in its solidarity. It is the symbol of Pebble Beach, though there is some debate as to whether the Pebble Beach community can enforce a trademark over use of its images (as they claim). It's hard to do it justice in words, but seeing it in person is very special.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC06359.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;South of 17 Mile Drive lies Carmel and the Big Sur region. The road is almost exclusively coast-bound through this area, with nerve-wracking cliffside hairpins the order of the day. One of the most beautiful spots is the Julia Pfeiffer Burns State Park and the McWay Falls. It is one of the few waterfalls in the world that empties directly into the ocean, doing so into an exquisitely turquoise cove. This picture was taken in September; the cove was far less picturesque on this second visit in the height of winter.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC07732.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we drove on from Big Sur and the day wound down, the weather turned for the worse. Drizzle and fog enveloped the coastline, making for some slightly hair raising driving along twisty cliffside roads shrouded in clouds. But we safely reached Santa Barbara after nightfall, and I'll write more about its sights next time. &lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Travel"></category><category term="California"></category><category term="USA"></category><category term="Highway 1"></category><category term="Pacific Coast"></category><category term="San Francisco"></category><category term="Monterey"></category><category term="Santa Barbara"></category><category term="Pebble Beach"></category><category term="17 Mile Drive"></category><category term="Big Sur"></category><category term="Road Trip"></category></entry><entry><title>New Year's in Sydney</title><link href="http://dominickng.com/blog/2013/01/new-years-in-sydney/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2013-01-17T00:00:00+11:00</updated><author><name>Dominick Ng</name></author><id>tag:dominickng.com,2013-01-17:blog/2013/01/new-years-in-sydney/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;One of the greatest things about living in Sydney is that Christmas and New Year fall in summer. This makes all manner of outdoor activities possible over the festive season, and one particular tradition is waiting out to catch the New Year's fireworks in Sydney Harbour. Using the famous Harbour Bridge as one of several launching bases, the fireworks are a spectacular way to bring in the new year. There's a 9pm show prior to the midnight fiesta as well, so that younger families can see their fireworks and get the little ones off to bed. In the end, there's something special about &lt;em&gt;feeling&lt;/em&gt; the concussive force of the exploding fireworks rather than just hearing and seeing them.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC00014.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've previously camped out all day on the Sydney Opera House foreshore, which features a truly &lt;em&gt;fantastic&lt;/em&gt; view of the Bridge just opposite, but you literally need to spend all day there to get a spot. This year I was feeling less adventurous, so around six o'clock in the evening I met up with some friends at Observatory Park, which surrounds Sydney Observatory just west of the centre of the city. There was still plenty of space even at this hour, and the view was excellent. It was a glorious summer day, with a cool breeze to ward off the hot sun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC00025.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The atmosphere in the park is raucous. Much of the city is shut down for New Year's celebrations, and people are &lt;em&gt;everywhere&lt;/em&gt;. Tourists from all over the world flock to Sydney at this time, making for a very diverse crowd. I took photos for what seemed to be a large group of Europeans sitting just near us, whilst couples, families, and friends all enjoyed the last hours of 2012 together. Skywriting planes twirled in the air, spelling out messages comprehensible and not, lasting just minutes before being blown away by the stiff breeze.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC08425.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, 9pm arrived, forewarned by a brief fireworks burst 20 minutes prior. And at the chime of the hour, the harbour bursts into light. Fireworks of all shapes, sizes, sounds, and hues explode up from their launching barges and into the dark night sky. Cheers echo around the park as people enjoy the show.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC08631.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New this year were these interesting mushroom-shaped fireworks that burst and grew outwards, with each stem in sync with all the others. It really is amazing the amount of control that the operators have over these coloured explosions.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC08429.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The show finishes with a resounding finale of light, sound, and colour to claps and cheers from the crowd. Families begin streaming for the park exits, eager to get home before the big rush at midnight. Now there's just a little under 3 hours to go before the main event - something that puts the 9pm show to shame every year.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC08716.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took these photos using my Sony NEX-5 on manual settings: 1/5 second shutter speed, ISO 800, F7.1, and manual focus. Ideally, I would have liked to use a much longer shutter speed to capture more of a "trails of light" effect, but I didn't have a tripod, so this was the best compromise I could come up with that didn't affect image quality too much or introduce excess noise. This is also probably the limit of my camera's ability to shoot at night - I'd have to upgrade to a substantially bulkier DSLR to do much better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/IMG_0532.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Laser + smoke + DJ + dance floor&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I left the park after the 9pm fireworks and made my way to a friend's party, catching up with many people I hadn't seen since going overseas in the middle of the year. The party was quite an extravagance, featuring an inflatable pool and bubbles, smoke machine, laser lights, and a full DJ set-up. We celebrated midnight with champagne and music, watching the fireworks telecast on the television. Now that's a truly Australian New Year.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Australia"></category><category term="Sydney"></category><category term="New Year"></category><category term="Fireworks"></category></entry><entry><title>Charlie Brown and Snoopy: The Charles Schulz Museum</title><link href="http://dominickng.com/blog/2013/01/charlie-brown-and-snoopy-charles-schulz/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2013-01-03T00:00:00+11:00</updated><author><name>Dominick Ng</name></author><id>tag:dominickng.com,2013-01-03:blog/2013/01/charlie-brown-and-snoopy-charles-schulz/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Like many other kids, my favourite page of the newspaper growing up was the comics page. Though it was later supplanted by the crossword page (though that's another story), my introduction to traditional media come in the form of those inked scribbles, filled with pithy wisdom, fantastic events, and witty observations.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/IMG_6003.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of my most beloved comics was &lt;em&gt;Peanuts&lt;/em&gt;, by Charles M. Schulz. I still vividly remember cleaning my local library out of &lt;em&gt;Peanuts&lt;/em&gt; cartoon books on a regular basis in primary school, and devouring the biography of Schulz that I discovered after learning how to use the brand-new library computer search tool. The whimsical adventures of Charlie Brown, Snoopy, Woodstock, Linus, Lucy, Sally, Schroeder, Peppermint Patty, and Marcie were one of my earliest guides to the vicissitudes of life. Being a young pianist, I naturally identified closest with Schroeder, his tiny piano, and his bust of Beethoven, but I loved all of them.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC07008.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC07041.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Roughly an hour's drive north of Berkeley is Santa Rosa, the town where Charles Schulz moved to in 1969, and resided in until his death in February 2000. Nowadays, one of the town's best attractions is the Charles M. Schulz Museum, dedicated to the life and livelihood of the cartoonist. There is simply no better place for a &lt;em&gt;Peanuts&lt;/em&gt; fan to visit than this shrine to Schulz, and I had the opportunity to do so, driving up to Santa Rosa with some friends in mid-November.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/IMG_5938.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC07044.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inside the museum are all kinds of memorabilia and paraphernalia from the world of &lt;em&gt;Peanuts&lt;/em&gt;. There are themed, rotating exhibitions (with "Famous People Referenced in &lt;em&gt;Peanuts&lt;/em&gt;" being on show during our visit), documentary and movie screenings, background history on the &lt;em&gt;Peanuts&lt;/em&gt; movie and television series, and busts, models, and cutouts galore of the &lt;em&gt;Peanuts&lt;/em&gt; characters.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC07018.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of the displays were decorated with vibrant colour, adding yet more life to the typically black and white comic strips. Donated artwork from third party artists also featured heavily, including models of Snoopy's kennel, paintings, mosaics, glass models, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC07022.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's even a detailed recreation of Charles Schulz's office and workdesk, along with a fascinating walk through his early life, army service, and the scribbled drawings that he was creating even then. It's easy to see how he became a cartoonist; he was an artist from the beginning.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC07031.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC07023.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And of course, there are hundreds and thousands of comic strips. Original strips lie under protective glass. Larger printouts decorate the walls, along with helpful explanations and ruminations on the underlying themes or goings-on in Schulz's life that inspired his work. A beautiful mosaic collage of Charlie Brown running to kick the football and Lucy ready to snatch it away dominates a wall, two stories tall and made entirely with panels of the comic itself.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC07026.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC07027.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Charles Schulz loved sports, and ice hockey was one of his favourites. He owned the Redwood Empire Ice Arena in Santa Rosa, and today the Arena is also known as Snoopy's Home Ice. Standing adjacent to the museum, it is home to the Warm Puppy Cafe, where Schulz would dine each day. It's a popular destination for the residents of Santa Rosa, and I was instantly jealous of the multitudes of young children who were already proficient on the ice. To have such ready access to a rink is something I could have only dreamed about growing up in country Australia. Scores of people - some with ice hockey gear, others evidently preparing to become figure skaters, and others just there to enjoy themselves - were whiling away this chilly fall day indoors and having a wonderful time.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/IMG_6024.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ice skating here is very cheap compared to Australia - the entry fee and skate hire was just $12. Having not ice skated for several years, I was initially pessimistic about how well I would do on the rink, but by the end of our three hours I had progressed to the point where I could skate around the arena at a respectable pace and without requiring the assistance of the wall. Not too bad if I do say so myself!  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/DSC07062.JPG"&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The gift shop featured this amazing Lego recreation of the rink&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The extensive gift store on the complex sells just about every kind of &lt;em&gt;Peanuts&lt;/em&gt; memorabilia you could imagine. I picked up some t-shirts for my brother, who is just about as big a &lt;em&gt;Peanuts&lt;/em&gt; fan as I am.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2013/IMG_6040.JPG"&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The World War I flying ace swoops over the gift store&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The museum is a loving tribute to an man whose cartoons has captivated millions. Charles Schulz may have died over a decade ago, but his legacy lives on in the museum and through the television shows, movies, merchandise, and most especially the comics that he left behind. Santa Rosa isn't the easiest place to get to, but it's definitely worth the visit for &lt;em&gt;Peanuts&lt;/em&gt; fans. &lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Travel"></category><category term="California"></category><category term="Charlie Brown"></category><category term="Snoopy"></category></entry><entry><title>Price gouging?</title><link href="http://dominickng.com/blog/2012/12/price-gouging/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-12-29T00:00:00+11:00</updated><author><name>Dominick Ng</name></author><id>tag:dominickng.com,2012-12-29:blog/2012/12/price-gouging/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;There is a lot of talk about how Australians are overcharged for hardware and software items compared to other countries. The Federal Parliament has convened a Standing Committee on Infrastructure and Communications to investigate "price gouging" in the IT industry, particularly from the likes of Apple, Adobe, Microsoft, and other tech giants.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The United States is a particularly common source of ire, and many people point at US prices compared to Australia as evidence for gouging. There's a number of reasons why a straight price comparison with the US can be misleading:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Australia has a fixed 10% sales tax applied to the vast majority of goods and services. This tax is included in the advertised price, meaning that the true price of something is actually about 91% of the price on the sticker.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The US has a variable rate of &lt;em&gt;state general sales tax&lt;/em&gt; that differs depending on your location. Some states, such as Alaska and Oregon, have &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt; general sales tax. California has one of the highest total tax rates in the US, at 9.75%; very few states have more than 10% tax in total.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most importantly, &lt;em&gt;almost all advertised US prices in stores and online do not include tax&lt;/em&gt;. The tax is added at the checkout or when finalising an online purchase. So when you see a camera priced at $600 in a US store, its true price will actually be somewhere in the region of $600 - $660, depending on the amount of tax applicable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Australia is a much smaller market than the United States, meaning that it's harder to achieve economies of scale in shipping and selling to an Australian audience. This means smaller price savings can be passed onto consumers due to sheer volume of sales.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, if you check out the &lt;a href="http://store.apple.com/us"&gt;US Apple Store&lt;/a&gt;, and add approximately 10% to the price of everything, you get nearly identical prices to the &lt;a href="http://store.apple.com/us"&gt;Australian Apple Store&lt;/a&gt;. Now, there may be an argument to say that the prices should be exactly identical, but maybe the Australian market is simply more expensive to service than the US on a per item basis.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn't to say that there isn't price gouging going on. Adobe's Creative Suite 6 Master Collection costs &lt;a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/creativesuite/mastercollection.html"&gt;$2,599 in the US&lt;/a&gt;, but&lt;a href="http://www.adobe.com/au/products/creativesuite/mastercollection.html"&gt; $4,344 in Australia&lt;/a&gt;! Subscription prices for the software are also 25% more expensive in Australia - $49.99 per month in the US against $62.99 per month in Australia. There's definitely something fishy going on here: software can be delivered for the same cost over the internet anywhere in the world, and tax differences don't account for such huge discrepancies.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Australians are certainly being overcharged for some things. But it pays to remember sometimes that prices are simply advertised differently in different countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;script type= "text/javascript"&gt;

Credit cards typically charge a currency conversion fee of 3% or so, and hit you with an exchange rate that's inevitably worse than the actual rate, sometimes by several percent. Travel cards are offered by various banks and currency exchange companies, but there are a plethora of hidden fees for loading money onto the card, as well as a fee for the card in the first place. Currency exchangers commonly charge a commission, as well as using a less-than-optimal conversion rate. I like to think of currency exchangers as sharks, swimming in the pre- or post-travel waters, ready to extract exorbitant payment from tired and nervous travelers.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2012/28-degrees-mastercard_4d532bbbef80c.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, Australians have a few decent and accessible options for avoiding these traps. The first option is the &lt;a href="http://www.28degreescard.com.au/"&gt;28 Degrees Mastercard&lt;/a&gt;. This is a very handy credit card offered by GE Finance, with the following features:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No annual fees&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No foreign currency conversion fees&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No international ATM withdrawal fees (other than those charged by the ATM operator)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Up to 55 days interest free on purchases (i.e. 25 days to pay your bill at the end of each month)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Foreign currency conversion uses_ the Mastercard spot rate at time of use_&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Security chip on the card and PIN (useful for Europe)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fully online application process (including online ID validation, assuming you have a passport, Medicare card, and are enrolled to vote at your current address)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, this card has no fees, and converts Australian dollars to international currencies at almost the precise exchange rate at the time of use. I've used the card without any problems all across Europe, and it's also handy for purchasing from online retailers who price in US dollars.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One downside of the 28 Degrees card is that it provides no rewards program for money spent on the card. However, it is intended as a travel card, and it succeeds in this domain handsomely. With the Australia dollar at historic highs (and forecast to remain at or above parity with the US dollar well into 2013), using this card for foreign exchange purchases can save hundreds of cumulative dollars in conversion fees and poor exchange rates. It's also handy for use on Amazon, and other websites that charge in foreign currency.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can use the 28 Degrees card to withdraw money from international ATMs, and this is by far the most efficient method of converting money. But, as a security measure, interest is charged on cash withdrawals (also known as &lt;em&gt;advances&lt;/em&gt;) immediately, rather than using any interest-free days. If you really want to avoid being charged interest on cash withdrawals, you can &lt;em&gt;prepay&lt;/em&gt; money onto the card, using BPAY. This is essentially like overpaying a credit card bill, so there is a positive balance on the card. For example:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your credit limit is $2000, and your balance is $0 (nothing owing)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You use BPAY to pay $500 to GE Finance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your balance is now $500, and your effective credit limit is $2500
Now, while your balance is positive, you can withdraw cash from ATMs using the 28 Degrees card without paying interest. This will last until the transaction where the balance goes negative and you've run out of the"extra" cash on the card. Regular credit card purchases also draw out of the extra money, so some care is needed in how you interleave withdrawals and payments.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, this method has many pitfalls. It takes a few days for BPAY to get the money to the card, so this is an operation that requires some foresight. If your card is stolen, then the extra money can be spent by a miscreant, and will be unrecoverable. And finally, credit card companies dislike it when their credit cards are used like this, as they are being duped out of interest payments. So overloading too much money onto the card (scuttlebutt suggests more than the credit limit on top) is cause for GE Finance to cancel the card. But a few hundred dollars here and there is much more palatable to them, and can mean huge savings in the long run for international travel.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit cards can sometimes prove tricky to acquire. This is particularly the case for students, who often have transitory, inconsistent, or non-existent incomes and credit records. Thankfully, another option is available for this situation: the &lt;a href="http://www.citibank.com.au/aus/banking/everyday_banking/citibank_plus.htm"&gt;Citibank Plus account&lt;/a&gt; with a Visa Debit card. This account is an everyday banking account with Citibank Australia that has just about every feature of the 28 Degrees card, including no fees, no exchange conversion or international ATM fees, and currency conversion at the Visa spot rate at time of use. The main differences are that there is no security chip on the card, and that you get a Visa Debit card rather than a credit card. Hence, it's really easy to open an account since there's no credit check. And pulling cash out of ATMs requires no dodgy preloading - it's all money that you already have sitting in the account. Electronic transfer into the account is as easy as with any other Australian bank account, so you can shuttle money in and out with ease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lack of a security chip on the Citibank Plus card is something of a letdown as the majority of cards issued in Australia are starting to include this feature. A chip is becoming increasingly necessary in Europe and Asia, and there are anecdotal reports of stores rejecting cards without chips. Still, given that the account is free to open and maintain, it's a no-brainer investment for someone who is ineligible for a credit card. I've used the Citibank Plus card in the US and across Asia, for purchases and for cash, and it's saved me a substantial amount in fees.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing that's important to keep an eye out for is that foreign card machines will occasionally ask you if you want your Australian card charged in AUD. This is almost always a trap to lock you into a worse exchange rate - always let your card do the conversion, rather than the merchant. This also applies on Amazon, which has a Currency Converter service that always gives you a pretty bad rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A final piece of traveling advice: before you leave on your overseas trip, find a currency conversion place that isn't in an airport and doesn't charge commission. Buy some foreign currency to help tide you over when you first arrive. You shouldn't need much more than a few hundred dollars in cash - it's not really safe to carry much more - but it can be invaluable to have ready cash just in case something goes wrong along the way.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT&lt;/strong&gt;: Thanks to Joseph, here's one more piece of traveling advice - make sure you call your credit card providers before departing on an overseas trip and tell them where you're going. Using your card internationally may be flagged as potential fraud and lead to your card being locked - very inconvenient when you're far from home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;script type= "text/javascript"&gt;

It's hard to believe that close to a decade has passed since the first one was released. Even now, the trilogy still seems fresh and innovative, its CGI hardly dated amongst many other poorer imitations that have not aged as gracefully. Howard Shore's incredible music remains a heavy part of the rotation through my headphones - and I have seen both the &lt;em&gt;Lord of the Rings&lt;/em&gt; symphony production, and watched the first two films with the fantastic Sydney Symphony Orchestra playing the score live. I'm very much looking forward to seeing &lt;em&gt;The Return of the King&lt;/em&gt; in a similar form next year.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2012/The-Hobbit-Wallpaper-the-hobbit-33042233-1920-1080.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've been very much looking forward to Jackson's return to Middle-Earth with &lt;em&gt;The Hobbit&lt;/em&gt;. The road to the film's production has been very rocky, punctuated by studio cash crises, fights over the film rights, and the departure of the original director, Guillermo del Toro. But finally, it seemed like all of the pieces fell into place. Peter Jackson would return to direct, and his writing, production, and effects teams from &lt;em&gt;Rings&lt;/em&gt; returned as well. All of the major cast members signed on again, Howard Shore would write the music, and an amazing Bilbo in Martin Freeman was added. Everything was looking peachy.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, slightly perturbing news started coming forth. &lt;em&gt;The Hobbit&lt;/em&gt; would be split into two movies. It would be shot in 3D at double the usual framerate - 48 frames per second, rather than 24 (the human eyes see 60 frames per second; they effect of a higher framerate is to "smooth" the film so it looks more realistic). Early footage was unenthusiastically received, and rather unflatteringly compared to BBC period dramas shot with similar framerates. Then the announcement that additional material from Tolkien's short stories would be incorporated, expanding &lt;em&gt;The Hobbit&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;strong&gt;three&lt;/strong&gt; movies - as long as the original trilogy, but from a far smaller source. Like many fans, I was beginning to get slightly worried. Could this team that I had such faith in be led astray by the advancing march of technology?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I shouldn't have been worried. I saw &lt;em&gt;The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey&lt;/em&gt; last week, in all of its 3D, high framerate, Dolby Atmos sounding glory, and it was brilliant. Yes, it was definitely too long (at least half an hour could have been cut from the first half), but Jackson has perfected the vision he put forth in &lt;em&gt;Rings&lt;/em&gt;, and produced incredible cinematic art doing it. The acting performances are uniformly  It's not every day you get to the cinema 45 minutes early for a film, and the line is already 150 metres long, snaking upstairs to the next floor.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3D is used excellently in the film. There are many sequences where the camera swoops around the running company, indoors and outdoors, and the immersive 3D effect really makes you feel like you're the camera, flying over the running dwarves, wizard, and hobbit as they flee pursuit. The waterfall at Rivendell is simply spectacular in this format, as are the underground sequences that dominate the second half. The high framerate adds a kind of hyperrealism and clarity to the film, like no other film I've ever seen, and it also distinguishes &lt;em&gt;The Hobbit&lt;/em&gt; visually from &lt;em&gt;The Lord of the Rings&lt;/em&gt;. It's hard to describe precisely what it looks like... just go see it for yourself. I can see why the look of the film has been divisive, but it is definitely unique.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dolby's Atmos sound technology surrounds the audience completely with speakers. The sound effects genuinely feel like they're coming from all around you - voices fade in and out over your shoulder, the clang of weapons and fighting are enough to make you spin around to see who's there. It was all too much for one person, who left our screening early on complaining that it was just too loud. I thought it was perfect from our position three rows from the very back of the cinema.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Hobbit&lt;/em&gt; is intended as a less serious work than &lt;em&gt;The Lord of the Rings&lt;/em&gt;; the latter pulses with the urgency brought on by the impending triumph of ultimate evil over the entire world, whereas the former focuses on evictees trying to evict their evictor, and the growth in character of an unexpected member of their company. The Dwarven cast of &lt;em&gt;The Hobbit&lt;/em&gt; contributes to this; much humour and light-heartedness is wrought from their antics through the film, as was from Gimli in &lt;em&gt;Rings&lt;/em&gt;. But right from the start, the ominous haze that hangs over &lt;em&gt;The Lord of the Rings&lt;/em&gt; is missing from &lt;em&gt;The Hobbit&lt;/em&gt;; the placid opening is completely different to the introduction of the Ring that opens the earlier trilogy. (Though the opening of &lt;em&gt;The Hobbit&lt;/em&gt; ties in wonderfully with &lt;em&gt;The Fellowship of the Ring&lt;/em&gt;). It's funny - the great advancement in film technology seems at odds with the more lighthearted storyline. It's not a bad thing - just a strange artefact of the prequel coming out a decade after its sequels.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The music reuses many of the themes from &lt;em&gt;The Lord of the Rings&lt;/em&gt;, helping to tie the films together. Hearing each familiar melody was like welcoming back dear old friends. Of the new music, the &lt;em&gt;Misty Mountain&lt;/em&gt; tune (sung by the Dwarven company in the film) is Howard Shore's latest instantly iconic leitmotif. Variations of the theme recur throughout the entire film - perhaps to the point of overexposure. The tune also supplies the melody for Neil Finn's stunning &lt;em&gt;Song of the Lonely Mountain&lt;/em&gt;, which plays over the final credits of the film. Crowded House, Finn's band, is one of my favourite musical groups, and the soundtrack is worth buying for this song alone.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This experience cost $17 - at least one third cheaper than in Australia for the full 3D and high framerate deal. For those still waiting for the film to come out, I highly recommend watching the &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/pjacksonwingnutfilms"&gt;video production diaries&lt;/a&gt; on Peter Jackson's YouTube page. You'll get a picture of the love, dedication, and detail that has gone into making this film, and be ever more excited to see it. I have faith that the team will continue this over the next two installments as well.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, while the film was extremely long (close to 3 hours, with a very slow and patient opening...), it was worth every moment. I may wish for tighter editing, but it remains a tour de force in world-building, in immersive cinema, in stories and pictures that take you to another world. I've seen complaints that nothing really happens in the film. This is true to some extent, but &lt;em&gt;The Hobbit&lt;/em&gt; makes no pretense at being an action adventure. Rather, it is a beautiful, faithful, and loving adaptation of a classic work of fiction.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a final admission: I've never actually read either &lt;em&gt;The Hobbit&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;The Lord of the Rings&lt;/em&gt; (!). I've tried to read both several times since I was in high school, but I've never made it very deep into either. The prose in _The Lord of the Rings _is fairly infamous for being difficult to read, but I've decided that there's no excuse for me to have not read its predecessor (it's already on my &lt;a href="http://blog.dominickng.com/2012/12/kindle-paperwhite.html"&gt;Kindle&lt;/a&gt;!). Stay tuned. &lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Movies"></category><category term="The Hobbit"></category></entry><entry><title>Kindle Paperwhite</title><link href="http://dominickng.com/blog/2012/12/kindle-paperwhite/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-12-15T00:00:00+11:00</updated><author><name>Dominick Ng</name></author><id>tag:dominickng.com,2012-12-15:blog/2012/12/kindle-paperwhite/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've loved reading for as long as I can remember. Some of my earliest memories are going grocery shopping with my mother every week, and each time getting to buy a new &lt;a href="http://www.randomhouse.com/golden/"&gt;Little Golden Book&lt;/a&gt; - short picture books about nursery rhymes, nature, science, and fairy tales. I built up a huge collection of them, before they were given away to cousins as I grew older.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I grew older I moved into more weighty tomes. Nowadays I own many, many books, and have borrowed many more from friends and libraries. I love the feel of books and the stories they contain within. Yet books are somewhat inconvenient. Tomes such as George R.R. Martin's &lt;em&gt;A Game of Thrones&lt;/em&gt; or Douglas Hofstadter's_ &lt;em&gt;Godel, Escher, Bach&lt;/em&gt;: An Eternal Golden Braid_ are very chunky, and don't lend themselves well to being carted around. Sometimes I'll be reading several things at once, but be restricted in how many of those things I can take with me wherever I go.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enter an e-reader. A couple of weeks ago, I purchased a Kindle Paperwhite - the newest model in the Amazon line of e-readers. This slim little device has a 6-inch screen, and 2GB of memory that can hold close to a thousand books at a time. It has wireless, so you can connect to your Amazon account and download new books on the fly. You can email your own files (like PDFs) to a special @kindle.com email address, and they'll be forwarded to the device. All this in a package that's actually smaller than most paperback books.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2012/IMG_0436.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I picked up the official Amazon onyx black leather case for the Kindle as well to give it some extra protection. The case has a beautiful, upmarket feel to it, yet adds little to their Kindle's size. There are magnets in the case which automatically wake the Kindle up when you open the case, and put it to sleep when you close it, saving a press on the tiny on/off button hidden at the bottom of the device. I highly recommend the extra protection, as it really gives me the confidence to treat the Kindle as a go-anywhere device.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Impressively, the Paperwhite also has LED backlighting. Instead of pointing up out of the screen, as with LCD screens, the lights in the Paperwhite are reflected downwards, towards the words on the display. This makes the screen very comfortable to look at - I inevitably find that the LCDs in computers and smartphones tire my eyes out and prompt headaches after prolonged use. I haven't really found a use for a tablet in my life - the combination of a smartphone and a MacBook Air easily handles all of my computing needs - but the Kindle definitely fills a niche and a need.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2012/IMG_0437.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Same settings as the picture above, just with the room light off&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The backlight is capable of dialing up to a very high brightness - perfect for reading outdoors in strong sunlight. I haven't yet needed the backlight on, but the screen is very nice even without the backlight - it has a very high resolution for an e-reader, leading to extremely crisp text. Reading on the Kindle is easy, comfortable, and convenient - with most of my library with me at all times, I can read whatever I like, whenever it strikes my fancy. I can search through all of the books, look up word definitions on the fly, and fiddle extensively with the font, margins, and spacings. On top of all that, after two weeks of relatively heavy usage, the battery isn't even below halfway yet. The Kindle is advertised as lasting for up to two months for the average reader, and I definitely believe that.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Paperwhite is solely controlled by a touchscreen. Page turns are a tap of the screen away, with a menu rolling into view with a tap at the top of the screen. Unfortunately, having gotten used to the ultra-response iPhone touchscreen, the e-reader feels glacially slow. Some touches take nearly a second for a response. The e-ink technology also requires an unsightly full refresh every few touches (where the screen essentially wipes itself clean), further slowing response time. Sadly, this is necessary given the current limits of e-ink technology. But, given how long e-ink devices last on a battery charge, and how comfortable they are to read books on, the lack of responsiveness is more than an acceptable compromise.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2012/IMG_0441.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Damn ads&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing that does aggravate me is that the Kindle displays ads by default, and Amazon charges you $20 for the privilege of removing those ads. While the ads never display when you're actually reading, they occasionally pop up as you're navigating your library, and display permanently as a screensaver when the Kindle is locked and asleep. Thankfully, the screensaver uses no power (hooray e-ink!), but it's still odious to open my Kindle and be greeted by paid advertising. Still, it's not odious enough to convince me to part with an additional $20.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one feature of a book that I truly miss is ease of navigation. I miss being able to simply &lt;em&gt;open&lt;/em&gt; a book to a random page. Often I'll be looking for a specific passage that I know is in a certain section of the book. The chapter navigation offered in the Kindle is very good, but doesn't quite replicate that ability to flick quickly through a book, peeking at pages every now and again. You also can't skip past five or ten pages at a time - the only available options are jumping to a linked chapter, or turning the page. I'd even settle for a function that jumps to a random page in a specified section of a book. But I guess you can't have everything.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, the Kindle Paperwhite is quickly becoming one of my favourite gadgets. I take it almost everywhere with me, and it has drastically cut down on my dead time - I can simply read for a while if I'm ever caught in a waiting situation.

That being said, there are some very, very pretty mountains (particularly for someone who has grown up on the driest continent on earth).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2012/DSC07224.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Salt Lake City was the site of the 2002 Winter Olympics (a fact made famous by 2012 Presidential candidate Mitt Romney's leadership), and many of the facilities constructed for the Games remain present in the city. The large Olympic Oval is now used as an ice skating and ice hockey rink.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2012/DSC07455.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the rink we got to watch people learn curling. Possibly the most hilarious sport ever invented, curling is like lawn bowls on ice played between teams. Two of the players on each team are called "sweepers", and they use brooms to brush the ice in front of the "stone" (puck/ball). This then alters the path of the stone, allowing it to continue further or stop earlier depending on the sweeping. Players generally wear shoes on the ice rather than skates (balance would be much more challenging on skates!), and the whole spectacle is great fun to watch.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2012/IMG_0398.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Around an hour south of Salt Lake City is Thanksgiving Point, featuring the Museum of Ancient Life. Touted as housing the world's largest display of mounted dinosaurs, the museum is a fascinating walk through millions of years of history of life on earth.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2012/DSC07373.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The museum is laid out in a linear path through time, starting with the very beginnings of life on Earth before reaching the dinosaur eras.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2012/DSC07242.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stunning skeleton models and fossils occupy every nook and cranny of the museum. Many are set in recreations of their natural environments (at least, the environments that paleontologists believe they lived in).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2012/DSC07249.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The museum described the process of locating, identifying, and classifying fossils in great detail - often complementing the exhibits. One of the most impressive displays was a Supersaurus and an Ultrasaurus, towering over a three storey high room. These things were truly enormous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2012/DSC07273.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This little carnivore was huddling in the shadows of the Supersaurus and Ultrasaurus. Somehow, I think it wouldn't have been too frightened of their bulk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2012/DSC07295.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, no dinosaur museum is complete without the King, Tyrannosaurus Rex. The Museum of Ancient Life featured two of them, stomping down in a room that otherwise featured clutches of dinosaur eggs and a water exhibit. Even without flesh, the skeletons were intimidating, particularly the enormous jaws with rows of jagged teeth.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2012/DSC07332.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Is anyone else amused by the comically small arms of T-Rex?&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the age of the dinosaurs came to a close, other enormous forms of ancient life came to prominence. One of the areas that prospered was the ocean. Each flipper of this enormous turtle is larger than a adult human; many people could comfortably fit underneath the bony shell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2012/DSC07338.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2012/DSC07347.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Carnivorous fish also came a long way, laying the evolutionary grounds for modern day sharks. To give a sense of scale, a young child could easily stand inside the mouth of this large shark predecessor below. It's a bit of a shock to turn the corner and run into, that's for sure!  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2012/DSC07358.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some more fanciful exhibits were also on display, including this one of a giant woolly mammoth, under attack from prehistoric humans armed with rocks and spears. I'm not exactly sure whether this sort of thing happened very often, but it makes for a great mental image.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2012/DSC07364.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, outside the museum was a pen with reindeer! We were quite excited to see them; I have never before seen one of these Christmas-themed animals. Unfortunately, I can report no bright red-nosed varieties - just the standard brown. I did feel a bit sorry for them: I wouldn't like to carry those horns around on my head all day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2012/DSC07389.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Utah is also blessed with many beautiful landscapes. We visited to the Antelope Island State Park, which sits in the Great Salt Lake to the north of Salt Lake City. The Lake has no outlet flows, and so is almost perfectly still. Surrounded by mountains, fresh air, and the salt lake, the area is tranquil and beautiful. The reflections of the snow-capped mountains in the Lake are particularly stunning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2012/DSC07467.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Antelope Island is famous for being home to a herd of around 500 bison. We managed to catch a glimpse of some of these up close as they crossed the road, stopping traffic in both directions. Thankfully, the island also features its namesake antelopes. We spotted stopped by grassland with some antelope in the distance, and crept as close as we dared to take some photos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2012/DSC07498.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2012/DSC07476.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's hard to overstate just how beautiful Antelope Island was. We had brilliant blue sky (though the air temperature was relatively chilly), the amazingly still lake, rolling hills, and not very many other people. It was tranquil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2012/DSC07483.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we left our hotel on the last day, we happened upon this touching sight. I don't think I've ever seen a wedding vehicle so organically decorated.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2012/DSC07507.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our final destination in Utah was the Bonneville Salt Flats, around two and a half hours to the west of Salt Lake City. The Flats are an enormous, densely packed salt pan that stretches as far as the eye can see in all directions. Getting there was a long trek on the Interstate highway, before turning off onto a little country road that curved out onto the Flats before disappearing entirely, dumping us in the middle of the salt. The air is crisply chill at this time of year, matching the stark whiteness all around. There is a strange light in the air as sunlight reflects off the whiteness.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2012/DSC07557.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Flats are where many a daredevil straps rocket engines to their car and guns it in the hopes of setting a land speed record. Great stretches of the Salt Flats are just that - perfectly flat - and the isolation is perfectly suited to driving very, very, very fast, with large run-off areas in case of emergency. Each year, a special mile section is marked out by the Bureau of Land Management, in preparation for that year's crop of speedsters.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2012/DSC07590.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We didn't attempt any records in our more pedestrianly-spec'ed car (they recommend against it in winter as there many be treacherously slushy or watery sections hidden under the salt). However, pictures of our little Toyota Yaris did look as if they had come straight out of a car commercial.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2012/DSC07553.JPG"&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Now that's an advertising shot if I ever saw one.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Utah was a terrifically interesting place to visit. It highlighted many differences in people, climate, landscapes, and wildlife between the US and Australia - even between California and other states. Now, it was quite bitterly cold, and a car is mandatory for getting around with any form of convenience. But there are quite a few worthwhile attractions - and I feel like I learnt much about heartland America from my visit.  &lt;/p&gt;

Today I'm writing about state #3, Utah, and its capital, Salt Lake City. I visited with my friend Tara over the Thanksgiving weekend.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2012/DSC07110.JPG"&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;State Capitol building; not the House of Congress!&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2012/DSC07121.JPG"&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Snow-capped mountains to the south east&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanksgiving is the most important holiday in the US. Celebrated on the 4th Thursday of November each year, it was originally founded as a religious observance in the aftermath of the Civil War. The placement of Thanksgiving creates a six week long holiday period encompassing Christmas and New Year as well.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The week around Thanksgiving is the busiest time for domestic travel in the US, as people make their way back to their families. There are long lines at airports, flights become heinously expensive, and the roads become clogged. Don't travel to the States around Thanksgiving if you can avoid it! That being said, traveling on Thanksgiving Day was a relatively painless affair, with the main problem being a lack  of public transport at either end.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2012/DSC07078.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanksgiving Day is when the US shuts down. Having flown into Salt Lake City on that day, I was wandering around Salt Lake and marveling at how dead this city of 200,000 people was. Massively wide streets, with nary a car nor a soul in sight. I couldn't imagine Sydney, or even Newcastle (an equivalently sized city to SLC in New South Wales, Australia) ever being this quiet in the middle of town. Even on Christmas Day, there will still be people and bustle. Nothing quite like this.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2012/DSC07209.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Salt Lake City is very cold at this time of year, with night-time temperatures dropping to freezing, and daytime highs barely nudging 12 degrees celsius. There's a kind of bitter chill in the air that attacks any exposed skin: warm headwear and handwear is strongly recommended! Thankfully, the long johns that I bought myself in preparation for the trip weren't yet required - but I imagine that they would be welcome come January.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2012/DSC07413.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The Temple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The city is a major outpost of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (Mormonism). The centre of the city is dominated by an enormous Mormon temple, office buildings, gardens, information centres, and function buildings owned and operated by the church. Indeed, the main streets of the city are the four which border the temple: North Temple, South Temple, East Temple, and West Temple.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2012/DSC07146.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an aside, logical American street naming has decreed that North Temple runs east-west, along the north border of the Temple; thus, West North Temple is the western end of the street, and vice-versa for east. Similarly logic runs for the other three streets. Devout Mormons are expected to give 10% of their annual income to the Church as a tithe; and this explains how they can fund structures like the Temple.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2012/DSC07446.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the Temple is used primarily for Mormon marriages. Here, a helpful guide told us that the couple is married "for life and eternity", whereas a marriage in a regular Mormon church is only for life. Sadly, non-Mormons aren't allowed inside, and even Mormons require special permits in order to enter. We would only be able to observe the temple from outside.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2012/DSC07448.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, 50% of the population of Salt Lake City is Mormon, and it sits in the "Mormon corridor" forged by widespread settlement activities in the 1800s. The Temple area holds two information centres, an enormous Church office building, a Tabernacle, a large conference center, extensive gardens and fountains, a hotel block-cum-function centre, and the world's biggest family history library (with over 2 billion people documented).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2012/DSC07421.JPG"&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Inside the information centre&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2012/DSC07419.JPG"&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The Tabernacle organ&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The information centres contained a wealth of information about Mormonism and the Book of Mormon. Followers believe the Book of Mormon to be another gospel, describing how Christ visited the Americas. There were many displays on the good charitable work done by the Church and its members around the world, and tributes to the Living Prophets (all caucasian men) who head the Church today. On a table sat copies of the Book of Mormon, translated into many different languages, and upstairs sat an ornate sculpture of Christ surrounded by flowers.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2012/DSC07438.JPG"&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Holiday lights&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Outside, the entire area was lit up with lights for the holiday season. There were people and families everywhere, braving the near freezing temperatures to enjoy the colours. Just across the road was the Deseret Book Company, purveyor of Mormon readings of all kinds. I hadn't realised that there was such a massive Mormon book business, but this store proved me wrong. Young adult fiction, historical fiction, religious texts, political analysis, contemporary non-fiction, all this and more was represented in this store.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2012/IMG_0392.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found out after the trip that Utah is the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._states_by_population_growth_rate"&gt;second fastest growing state by population&lt;/a&gt; in the US. I'm guessing that part of this is due to migration, but in Salt Lake City, we also saw many young families with two, three, four, even five children. During the night-time shopping sales, children far outnumbered adults on the streets. It was even unusual to see teenagers hanging out in groups of just one gender - just about everyone I saw of that age, be it in the streets or on the ice-skating rink, seemed to be paired up. I've never been anywhere quite like it. Salt Lake City is also overwhelming Caucasian (~75% of the population), which again is very different to almost every other city I've visited. Even in European cities, the sheer weight of tourists tends to ensure at least a facade of diversity (though Uppsala in Sweden comes close). I definitely felt a little out of place in the city, and I think I got a couple of puzzled looks and glances every now and again.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2012/DSC07447.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that, I should bring this post to a close. The next one will continue the Utah adventure, featuring more of Salt Lake City, dinosaurs, bison, salt plains, and state parks! &lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Travel"></category><category term="Utah"></category><category term="Salt Lake City"></category><category term="USA"></category></entry><entry><title>NBA Basketball</title><link href="http://dominickng.com/blog/2012/12/nba-basketball/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-12-03T00:00:00+11:00</updated><author><name>Dominick Ng</name></author><id>tag:dominickng.com,2012-12-03:blog/2012/12/nba-basketball/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;America is a country of sports fans. The three biggest sports are gridiron football, basketball, and baseball. Having experienced the insanity of college football, I set my eyes on the NBA, attending the December 1st game between the Golden State Warriors and Indiana Pacers at Oracle Arena in Oakland. For those unfamiliar with the nomenclature, California is sometimes called "the Golden State", and the Warriors are the local Bay Area team.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2012/IMG_0427.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NBA teams play several times a week, adding up to 82 games a season - before adding in playoffs! This is in sharp contrast to the more bruising gridiron, where the season ticks by one game per week and less than 20 per year. However, all pro sports in America share a "conference" system, where the teams are divided into regions that compete for playoff spots, before advancing to knock-out games between the ultimate winners of each region. With over 30 teams, this seems an appropriately fair way to run things.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The level of support for sport in America is astounding. The vast majority of the 20,000 seat arena was filled for the game, with raucous music, shouting, ice-cream and drink sellers in amongst people jostling to get to their seats. I thought Australians loved sport. But Americans love watching sport, and they love watching it live.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Golden State Warriors actually have an Australian player - centre Andrew Bogut, recently traded from Milwaukee. Unfortunately, Bogut is currently injured, and did not participate in the game. Warriors fans seem to think that he's a great player - he just need to recuperate and get back on the court.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game itself was an entertaining affair - I could appreciate the skill of the players as the dribbled, stepped, spun, and shot their way through. I still don't understand the foul system at all (as best I can tell, it's just totally arbitrary), but basketball moves &lt;em&gt;fast&lt;/em&gt;, and keeps moving. In the end, the Warriors edged out the Pacers 103-93, built primarily on a burst of accurate scoring right after half time. The double digit buffer from this was never lost, greatly pleasing the home crowd.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2012/IMG_0432.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike football, basketball moves forward with relatively minimal interruptions. Advertising at basketball is typically of the more subtle background billboard variety, as opposed to the in-your-face televised kind in gridiron. The breaks (due to timeouts or quarter breaks) are filled with a crazy variety of entertainment and ritual, including:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the American national anthem, performed by an acapella group called "The Singing Priests". Members of the Coast Guard were holding the flag during the anthem&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;multiple cheerleader routines at varying levels of clothing skimpiness&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a junior dance group performance (thankfully properly clothed)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;live band and DJ sets, with particularly good (or bad) dancers in the crowd highlighted on the big screens&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a trick-shooting brigade, where shooters in turn sprinted towards the basket and hurled themselves into the air via a trampoline, doing flips and such before dunking the ball. As the spectacle continued, they began passing the ball back to the next person running; the grand finale involved the whole team passing, catching, and flipping before a final dunk&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a boys and girls basketball match during halftime. The boys were much bigger than the girls, and so the girls were unsurprisingly walloped. By the end of their game, the crowd was roaring when the girls had the ball, and practically silent when the boys did&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a t-shirt giveaway, with guys on tricycles riding around the court, and firing t-shirts high into the crowd using modified air guns&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a pizza giveaway, with free pizzas given to loudly cheering people in the crowd&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an aside, there are some poor chaps at the game whose job it is to wipe away the sweat of players who have fallen to the court. I don't envy them, but I suppose if you're a big basketball fan it's a good way to get an amazing view from courtside.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the highlight of the game was probably this amazing shot from Jarret Jack. As the clock ticked to zero at the end of the third quarter, Jack found himself with three-quarters of the court between himself and the basket. No problem! He launched the ball and sunk an incredible 3-point shot, clean as a whistle. What a spectacle to see live! &lt;/p&gt;

So far, I've made it to three, with plans for six more tentatively in the pipeline. Today I'm going to write about state # 2: Washington State, and its capital Seattle.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2012/DSC06543.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The home of Boeing, Amazon, and Microsoft, Seattle is nestled between the Olympia mountains to the west, and the Cascade mountains to the east. A seaport city, the Pugent Sound winds north from the docks to the west up to the Pacific Ocean.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2012/DSC06551.JPG"&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The Olympic Sculpture Park, overlooking the sea and a busy highway&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I visited in October, and was promptly informed by my friend Tara that I had arrived just in time. Through the winter months, gloom descends on Seattle in the form of grey clouds and rain. The surrounding mountains act like a bowl, trapping the cloud above the city and robbing it of blue skies until the spring arrives. While I was there, the weather was glorious - brilliant sunny days, with just a hint of a chill breeze. The sunshine and seaside reminded me of my home shores of Sydney, Australia. The people are diverse, and very progressive - further reminders of home.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I saw of the city itself was beautiful - incredibly clean, spacious, green, and modern. The public transport was extensive and efficient, making it easy to get around. It's also very cheap - just a few dollars gets you from the airport into the city, on an elevated train ride with a great view. Unlike San Francisco, which is grungy and gritty in many places, Seattle is neat and tidy. I'm told that the city was hit hard by the financial crisis, but it's hard to tell from first glances. Having giant technology and aviation companies around probably helps a lot too.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2012/DSC06536.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I loved the Pike Place Market. It's a large, undercover bazaar just south of Downtown with buskers, tasty foods, unique fashions, striking heirlooms, and knick-knacks galore. Seattle is the home town of Starbucks, and the original Starbucks shop is still open down on Pike Place Market. It is almost unrecognisable as a Starbucks due to local heritage laws requiring its design to abide with that of the surrounding area. Still, a steady stream of tourists (like me) sidle by, taking photos of the familiar-yet-not coffee shop.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2012/DSC06577.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most recognisable structure in Seattle is the Space Needle. Built for the 1962 World Fair, the Needle rises over Downtown Seattle, and features a revolving restaurant up top and de-facto standard souvenir shop in the bottom. Just about every photo you can find advertising Seattle will feature the Needle somewhere, so iconic has it become.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2012/DSC06564.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The northern suburb of Fremont had further surprises. Can you guess who this fellow is? (Hint: my original guess was the doomed Captain Smith of the Titanic. Tara laughed a lot. It's not him).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2012/DSC06594.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This enormous statue of Lenin, 5 metres tall, and surrounded by flames, stands in front of an ice cream shop in the centre of Fremont. Originally erected half a world away in what is now Slovakia, the statue was spirited away as communism fell in the late 1980's. Destined for the scrapheap, it was purchased by Lewis Carpenter, and imported into the United States. After Mr Carpenter's untimely death in a car accident in 1994, the statue was finally mounted in the Fremont area, whilst the Carpenter family continues to look for a buyer ($250,000 anyone?).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2012/DSC06621.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just south of Belltown are the Salmon Locks, which raise ships up from sea level in the Pugent Sound to the higher waters of Salmon Bay. The locks also feature special "steps" that allow the salmon to continue their migration each year into the Bay to spawn (and also give tourists a nice viewing spot to watch them). An enthusiastic National Parks ranger regaled to us the importance of the salmon in the food chain, as we watched the occasional fish swim by a windowed section of the steps.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2012/DSC06623.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The locks are quite fun to watch in operation, as they raise and lower ships. As we left, we noticed this hot-tub boat, full of revelers soaking up the curious attention of the people lining the shore. If nothing else, it certainly was attention grabbing.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2012/DSC06632.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2012/DSC06630.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's even Lauren Jackson's basketball jersey on the wall!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most authentic Australian experience I've had in the US so far was at the Kangaroo and Kiwi pub, located just north of the locks in Ballard. Housed in a former library, the pub has rugby playing on the screens, framed cricketing memorabilia on the walls, and "blokes" and "sheilas" proudly on the toilet doors. I had a Matilda lamb burger for lunch, with a ginger beer to wash it down. Just about the only thing out of place was the comically large Fosters that the guy on the table next to us was drinking - I don't think I've ever seen someone go into a pub Down Under and have Fosters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2012/DSC06684.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the home of Microsoft, Seattle is also home to a Microsoft store. Hilariously enough, it's right opposite a very busy Apple Store in a shopping mall. The Microsoft store is an interesting experience - the place sells phones, PCs, Xboxs, peripherals, and all sorts of other tech bits and pieces. There are videos screens side-by-side ringing the entire store - and the retail assistant proudly told us how they were all controlled from Microsoft's head office in Redmond down the road.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2012/IMG_0282.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were invited to try out the &lt;a href="http://www.bingiton.com/"&gt;Bing It On&lt;/a&gt; challenge - a blind experiment where you are presented with search results from either Google or Microsoft's Bing search engine, and you have to choose which one you prefer. Supposedly, most people prefer Bing's results - but we had a tie, followed by a win for Google. Nevertheless, we won two $25 vouchers to spend in the store for taking the challenge. I spent mine on two cute dragon things, whilst Tara spent hers on something more practical: a power board. This was just minutes after I had dropped several hundred dollars on a brand new iPhone 5 in the Apple Store opposite - quite a stark contrast indeed.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2012/DSC06661.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seattle is also home to the University of Washington, the state's preeminent higher education institution. The university is stunningly beautiful - rows upon rows of cherry trees line one plaza, and a spectacular waterfall sits in the middle of another. Powered by the generosity of the technology sector and Microsoft in particular, its computer science school is a powerhouse.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2012/IMG_0288.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;This plaque represents over half a billion dollars.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the library, we found a plaque that honoured individuals and organisations who had given over $10 million or more to the university. There were at least fifty names on the list, representing &lt;em&gt;half a billion dollars of donations in and upon itself&lt;/em&gt;. Not counting the multitudes who would have given slightly less than $10 million. This philanthropy is really what sets US universities apart from those anywhere else in the world. Back home, the university itself has to raise money for new buildings and facilities. In the US, new buildings (and even rooms within those buildings) are seemingly always funded by some wealthy donor, alumni, or philanthropist. Allen Centers sit next to Gates Buildings, across from Hewlett-Packard Auditoriums and Wozniak Lounges. The facilities available to students in the best US universities are amazing, and they are made possible by the magnanimous donations made each and every day. There simply isn't the same attitude to giving back home, let alone the same amount of blindingly successful alumni.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2012/DSC06541.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, I was sad to leave Seattle (though right now I think the gloom would have me feeling different). It's a lovely city, with fine company, pretty sights, and a comfortably familiar atmosphere. I'd highly recommend a trip there - steering clear of the winter if you can.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;script type= "text/javascript"&gt;

Berkeley and Stanford have exceptional computer science programs that supply and are supplied by the companies of the Bay.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2012/DSC06841.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nestled in the heart of Silicon Valley in Palo Alto, Stanford University is one of the top academic institutions in the world. With just 15,000 students on an enormous campus, the university feels incredibly spacious and well laid-out. And it's simply beautiful. The predominant Mission-style architecture, with red-roof tiles and stucco wall finishings, gives a cohesive feel to the entire campus that I've not seen anywhere else. Both Berkeley and Sydney Universities exhibit a more chameleonic character, with buildings reflecting the prevailing design styles at the time of construction.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2012/DSC06909.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the main quadrangle a clutch of sculptures by Rodin (he of the famous Thinker) stood in proud bronze.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2012/DSC06849.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We learnt many fascinating tidbits about Stanford on our visit there.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It has one of the most successful athletic programs in the country; last year's Stanford quarterback, Andrew Luck, was the first pick in the NFL draft for this season and is currently playing was distinction for Indianapolis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The unofficial mascot is the Stanford tree, as the university has never been able to come up with an official mascot. This is as hilarious as it sounds: you can buy t-shirts that say "FEAR THE TREE", and someone dresses in a tree costume for football games&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Condoleezza Rice, former US Secretary of State, is currently on faculty as a political science professor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the university, we stopped by the campuses of Facebook, Apple, and Google. Being a weekend, the campuses were closed, but there were plenty of people wandering around each one taking photos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2012/DSC06943.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facebook, located just north of Stanford in Menlo Park, features this giant sign on the side of the road. Amusingly enough, if you look behind the sign, you can see that Facebook simply repurposed it from its previous owner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2012/DSC06945.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the carpark on the Facebook campus, we found a car that perhaps belongs to someone who takes the hackathon don't-leave-the-office-till-it's-done attitude a little too seriously.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2012/DSC06947.JPG"&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;I don't even want to imagine how long it takes for a tyre to do that&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our final stops were at the two 800-pound gorillas of Silicon Valley: Apple in Cupertino, and Google in Mountain View. Apple's campus has something of an elegance to it; the buildings are understated in style, and the whole area has an air of being a place where people come and do serious work that changes the world.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2012/DSC06989.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Out the front fly American, California, and Apple flags, as if to signify the pride Apple places in being a Californian and American company. "Designed by Apple in California" indeed.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2012/P1040929.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An aside: the primary buildings are located on a circular road and addressed as 1 through 6 Infinite Loop. This is a programming joke referring to a piece of code that does not terminate, like how one can simply drive around the loop road again and again.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2012/DSC_0344.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast, Google is like a playground. Brightly coloured Google bikes are everywhere for employees (and NOT, as it turns out, itinerant tourists) to get from place to place. The campus sprawls across a large swathe of Mountain View, with each building being unique in its own way. As the company expanded to take up more office space, the original character of each additional new building was maintained as it was refurbished for Google's purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2012/DSC_0359.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making your way to Building 44 leads you to the famous Android statues, where picture taking is encouraged. There are statues for each dessert-themed version of Android so far, perfectly summarising Google's light-hearted yet no-holds-barred approach to taking over the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know where my future lies. But there's every chance it'll be here in the Bay. With computer science so strong over here, powered by academic institutions and industry alike, there's no other place in the world more exciting to be in the technology field. These are all amazing places to visit, and I imagine they'd be even better places to work for.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Travel"></category><category term="Silicon Valley"></category><category term="California"></category><category term="USA"></category></entry><entry><title>Obama 2012</title><link href="http://dominickng.com/blog/2012/11/obama-2012/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-11-07T00:00:00+11:00</updated><author><name>Dominick Ng</name></author><id>tag:dominickng.com,2012-11-07:blog/2012/11/obama-2012/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I consider it a privilege to have been in California during the 2012 US Presidential Election.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;California is strongly Democratic (as in the political party), and Berkeley is a liberal bastion in the Golden State. Add a strongly left-leaning student body and a convenient time zone, and you have the ingredients for a euphoric night.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2012/IMG_0368.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tension began around 5pm, as polls on the East Coast closed and the counting began. Naturally, Romney took an early lead due to the concentration of small, sparsely populated Republican states and counties that counted votes quickly. But Obama's numbers clawed back as the night continued, as swing state after swing state went to Obama. Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin (the home of the Republican vice-presidential nominee Paul Ryan - Obama even won his home county!), and New Hampshire all went blue. Cheers for each one. Then the West Coast called in - California, Hawaii, Oregon, Washington State. New Mexico. Then Iowa. And finally, Ohio. Obama has won it. The Empire State Building has gone blue. The room erupted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We went down to Sproul Plaza on the UC Berkeley campus, where thousands of students and staff had gathered to watch the coverage on an outdoor screen. The atmosphere was electric: chants of "USA! USA! Four more years! Obama!" echoed throughout the night, people ran through the crowd draped in American and rainbow flags to wild cheers, and people danced and sang to "I Gotta Feeling", and "Party in the USA" (possibly the best reaction I've ever seen to a Miley Cyrus number).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fox actually did a live cross to a reporter at the plaza whilst we were waiting for the President's victory speech, resulting in wild screams for the network television audience. The concession speech passed, with momentary boos interjecting amongst Governor Romney's supposedly late-scripted remarks. And finally, after a long, long wait, the victory speech. The appreciation of a grateful President, who had won his final race. The biggest cheer of all as he finished, and acknowledged the crowds that had propelled him to the finish line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2012/IMG_0372.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have never experienced anything like it. Call the process archaic. Call it inefficient. Call it whatever you think. Standing there, late at night on the first Tuesday in November, I joined in the cheering, the chanting, the screaming, and the dancing. I felt the shared happiness, the elation that their man had won and won big in a close election. That was democracy in action.&lt;/p&gt;

These people describe themselves as people who work in fields that fit with their lifestyle and preferences, be it to travel around the world, achieve moral or ethical goals, or find self actualisation.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One story he told really struck me the wrong way. He was describing how he was being introduced to the marvels of Chinese factory production in the mid-2000s, and how, having just read "The Four Hour Workweek" by Timothy Ferriss, decided to try and combine the two concepts into a business idea.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To me, that just sounded like he was trying to drastically reducing his own working hours by outsourcing (and multiplying!) them to other people who would work for less and produce more.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not saying I have anything in particular against lifestyle entrepreneurs in general. And I recognise that there are economic arguments and the like involved too. But something about the story just seemed... wrong. It may have been the slightly cavalier way that he told it, or how it seemed to just trivialise people's lives, just because of the differing work expectations. &lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Outsourcing"></category></entry><entry><title>Hugs</title><link href="http://dominickng.com/blog/2012/10/hugs/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-10-28T00:00:00+11:00</updated><author><name>Dominick Ng</name></author><id>tag:dominickng.com,2012-10-28:blog/2012/10/hugs/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;There are times when all you need is a hug.  &lt;/p&gt;

Run by the Rotary club, the trip was designed to give international students a taste of country life in California, and how Americans who didn't dwell in the more urban areas made their lives. The day included visits to a nursery, a farm, a ranch, an olive oil plantation, and a historic preserved ranch.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2012/DSC06734.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The country areas of northern California are very similar to my home town in the Upper Hunter Valley of New South Wales, Australia. I found many of the sights familiar - the greenhouses of the nursery, the cattle rails on the ranch, the vines at the winery - and the stories told to us by the local guides and hosts recalled memories of home.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gentleman at the nursery, who was a very spritely 80 years old, told us how he had built it from the ground up, refusing to borrow money from the local bank to do so. He showed us the 3 feet deep lake they had built to collect water run-off from the greenhouse roofs, storing it for the drier months. He talked at length about the business of running the nursery, trying to match the gestation and nurturing of seedlings against potential demand, dealing with regulations for pesticide and chemical use, and the inversely proportional relationship between the amount of people required to run the nursery against the amount of technology utilised. He struck me as a genuine American businessman of yesteryear, of the kind who built his own fiefdom from scratch.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2012/DSC06737.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The family farm that we visited next was a strange affair. Since it's coming up to Halloween, there were pumpkins everywhere. We briefly sat in on a hilly-billy children's entertainer, before escaping that barn and wandering through herb gardens, a reconstructed Native American village, a corn maze (where we picked corn against the rules, don't tell!), and piles of pumpkins. We were even allowed to pick a pumpkin to take with us.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2012/DSC06744.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next followed a stop at an olive oil plantation. Here we were treated to an explanation of how olive oil is produced, with several surprising anecdotes. It turns out that smaller, green olives produce more oil by weight than larger olives. "Extra virgin" olive oil is simply oil that is produced from the first pressing of a set of olives; "pure" olive oil and "pomace" olive oil come from additional pressings that are usually heat or chemical assisted to extract those last drops of oil from the olives. Here we were able to sample many delicious oils (my favourite was probably a lemon olive oil mix), as well as tasty spinach dips and salsas.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2012/DSC06784.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now running quite late, we paid visit to a cattle ranch, hosted by a real American cowboy (who had an impressive wall of photographs with many famous Americans, include Ronald Reagan!). Here I learnt the distinction between grain-fed steak and grass-fed steak: grain-fed steak is more expensive, and features "marbles" of fat running through the meat that contribute to flavour. I also learnt that there are actually many cattle on the Hawaiian islands, but Hawaii itself cannot produce grain for the higher-quality steak demanded in the resorts. So cattle is shipped by sea to California for the winter, where they graze first on grass, and then on grain before being shipped back to Hawaii for consumption. We were treated to a demonstration of cattle ropin', spinning lasso and all, where the cowboy chased down and hooked the horns and feet of a young steer. Impressive stuff.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2012/DSC06799.JPG"&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;What are they doing here??!!&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our penultimate stop was at a small boutique winery that specialised in exotic blends. We tasted red and white blends, and were taught some of the nuances of wine tasting, including the aroma, the taste, and the aftertaste. Funnily enough, this location included some emus that lived alongside the goats in a paddock beside the vines. I didn't get a chance to ask our host where they had come from, as these are animals that are distinctly native to Australia, and are rather unexpected guests on a farm in California.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we arrived for a dinner BBQ at the Old Borges Ranch, which is a preserved example of an old American ranch prior to the second World War. Featuring a blacksmith, windmill, water well, and a stunningly old-style American home, the ranch gave us a great insight into country living over half a century ago. As the sun went down, we were treated to dinner with Rotarians and their families. It was a fitting end to a fun day.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2012/DSC06815.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a long, long trip, beginning at 8am and ending past 7:30pm. But it was comforting seeing just how similar country California was to my own home area. I've always felt that the US is the great precursor for Australia, the country that is most like us in terms of cultural makeup and development. Seeing these sights only reinforced that notion further. I wonder sometimes if the American experience serves as a kind of blueprint for what might come to pass for Australia. &lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Travel"></category><category term="Contra Costa"></category><category term="California"></category><category term="Country"></category><category term="USA"></category></entry><entry><title>Flight bookings</title><link href="http://dominickng.com/blog/2012/10/flight-bookings/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-10-17T00:00:00+11:00</updated><author><name>Dominick Ng</name></author><id>tag:dominickng.com,2012-10-17:blog/2012/10/flight-bookings/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Booking flights is a painful process. Fares can vary wildly depending on your booking date, when you're flying, what time you're flying, and more. It's often tricky to compare lots of airlines at the same time to find the best deals - this can mean thousands of dollars of difference.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flying from Australia means that layovers are often inevitable. Ensuring adequate transfer times (and minimizing overall layover time) can also be aggravating - particularly when there are multiple layover options with different airlines servicing different hubs.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2012/Screen+Shot+2012-10-17+at+17.41.23+.png"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've found a few sites that help make this whole process easier. &lt;a href="http://www.hipmunk.com/"&gt;Hipmunk&lt;/a&gt; is a general flight and hotel search website that seems to pick up just about every flight possible for searches. It has a great interface that lets you visualise costs, flight times, and layover lengths. This interface is absolutely streets ahead of anything else I've ever seen for flight searches, with great use of colour and space to convey the information. It also includes direct links to purchase tickets for the flights you choose - very handy when the flights are with multiple airlines.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2012/Screen+Shot+2012-10-17+at+17.45.37+.png"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hipmunk gets its data from &lt;a href="http://matrix.itasoftware.com/"&gt;ITA Matrix&lt;/a&gt;. While this site isn't as pretty as Hipmunk, it is substantially more comprehensive. Hipmunk will only let you search for flights with a maximum of 3 legs; Matrix will handle an arbitrary number of connections. Matrix also presents many more flight options and perturbations than Hipmunk seems to, allowing more flexibility in travel times.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, Matrix doesn't include links to purchase tickets, or search for hotels. This isn't too bad when all the flights are with a single airline, as you can go to that airline's website and do the booking there with the flight information Matrix gives you. However, for flights on multiple airlines, this means taking the flights that Matrix produces, and either using a travel agent, or tediously trying to track down the flights on other travel sites. This isn't quite so nice, but when you're optimising at this level I suppose it's much of a muchness.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, many airlines let you choose seats at booking or check-in. &lt;a href="http://www.seatguru.com/"&gt;SeatGuru&lt;/a&gt; is a great site that describes each airline's fleet, and the seats to try for or avoid on each plane. There's also airport information, details on in-flight amenities and services, and a wealth of travel tips. It's a convenient way of making sure you don't end up with a terrible seat for a long, long flight. &lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Flights"></category><category term="Airlines"></category><category term="Booking"></category></entry><entry><title>Night photography: making shutter speed, aperture, ISO work to your advantage</title><link href="http://dominickng.com/blog/2012/10/night-photography/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-10-11T00:00:00+11:00</updated><author><name>Dominick Ng</name></author><id>tag:dominickng.com,2012-10-11:blog/2012/10/night-photography/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I would describe myself as an amateur photographer. I like traveling, and much of the reason why I like traveling is to see new places and take photos. I get a kick out of taking great photos in amazing locations.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few years ago my dad recommended a new camera to me: the Sony NEX-5. It packs a fully-featured DSLR into a body that is only slightly larger than a point-and-shoot camera. It has a great automatic mode that I use for most daylight photography, as well as a fully programmable manual mode. Since its purchase, it has been a constant companion on all the trips I've taken, spanning 4 continents and numerous countries. I've learnt that there is simply no substitute for a high quality camera and a good lens. Nowadays the NEX-5 has been superseded by newer models, but it keeps going strong for me.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2012/NEX-5_with18_200.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo from &lt;a href="http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/SonyNex5Nex3"&gt;http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/SonyNex5Nex3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a few basic factors at play when taking photos, and each one interacts with the others to determine how a shot turns out. As I learnt more about using the manual camera mode, I realised that these were not nearly as complicated as I'd first thought.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shutter speed:&lt;/strong&gt; how long the lens of the camera stays open to take a picture. Typically measured in seconds: the longer the shutter speed, the longer the shot takes, and the more light enters the camera. Typical shutter speeds in daylight are fractions of a second; longer shutter speeds are commonly associated with "blurry" pictures due to the movement of the camera or the subject whilst the camera is capturing the shot.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aperture:&lt;/strong&gt; how "open" the lens of the camera is when you take your picture. A smaller aperture corresponds to less light being let into the camera, and vice versa. This is measured in &lt;em&gt;F-stops&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;F-numbers&lt;/em&gt;, and the basic rule of thumb is that the larger the F-stop, the smaller the aperture. Additionally, aperture affects the &lt;em&gt;depth of field&lt;/em&gt; of the shot: how much horizontal distance in the image is in focus. Larger F-stops (smaller apertures) result in &lt;em&gt;longer&lt;/em&gt; depths of field, meaning that objects at a wider range of distances can all be in focus at once.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ISO:&lt;/strong&gt; how light-sensitive the camera is. This is roughly analogous to the varying numbers on rolls of film (anyone remember them? ISO 100/200/400?). The lower the number, the less light sensitive the shot; higher numbers result in more noise. A typical test for a good camera is to check the amount of noise present in pictures taken at a very high ISO value (e.g. 12800); less noise means a better camera.
A particular challenge is night photography. The basic problem is that there is far less light available; and thus the camera must adjust its settings to compensate.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can lengthen the shutter speed, which potentially risks a blurred or smeared shot if the camera or subject is moving&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It can open the aperture wider (smaller F-stop number), which will reduce the depth of field&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It can increase the ISO, which may increase the noise and graininess of the shot&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In automatic mode, point and shoot cameras will typically try a combination of these, which combines their downsides. Hence, you get a shot like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2012/IMGP0270.JPG"&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;With apologies to Coldplay, in Sydney 2009&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, some situations are very difficult to take great shots at (e.g. rock concerts), but spectacular night portraits and landscapes can be taken with just a couple of tricks. The key is simple: use a tripod. This allows you to avoid the worst downsides (ISO too high, aperture too large), and control for the necessary ones (camera stability).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With your camera on a tripod, F16, ISO 200, and shutter speed of 25 seconds, you can take shots like this:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2012/DSC06700.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much better! The tripod compensates for the long exposure time, whilst the ISO is set as low as possible to ensure minimum noise.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long exposure times allow for some experimentation. The easiest thing to try is movement and light. The following shot was taken next to a busy expressway, with the same settings as above. Fast moving cars aren't picked up by the camera, but their headlights and taillights are:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2012/DSC05655.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this next shot, the subject is standing still whilst I run behind him, shining a torch around his outline and &lt;em&gt;at&lt;/em&gt; the camera while the exposure is running. It takes some practice to get right, but the effect can be amazing.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2012/DSC05646.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, a useful way of figuring out how to adjust your camera settings correctly in manual mode is to use the &lt;em&gt;exposure value&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;compensation&lt;/em&gt; (EV). In manual mode, your camera will display this number, e.g. the -0.7 here on the screen of my NEX-5.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2012/IMG_0001.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This number is roughly what the camera thinks of the exposure of the current shot: positive numbers indicate overexposure, whilst negative numbers indicate underexposure. It will change depending on your shutter speed, aperture, and ISO settings, as well as the relative brightness of the subject. For night shots, I generally prefer this number to be as close to 0 as possible, and so I use it to help adjust the settings as necessary.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully this post has inspired some night time photography! &lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Photography"></category></entry><entry><title>Cycling San Francisco</title><link href="http://dominickng.com/blog/2012/10/cycling-san-francisco/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-10-07T00:00:00+10:00</updated><author><name>Dominick Ng</name></author><id>tag:dominickng.com,2012-10-07:blog/2012/10/cycling-san-francisco/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;A few weekends ago, I went with a group of fellow international students to hire bikes and pedal around San Francisco. This was the first time I really explored the city and its western and northern most areas.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2012/IMG_0982.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We spent around seven hours all up pedaling around the city, and saw many amazing things. We also experienced the fickleness of San Francisco weather: the conditions varied from brilliant sunshine to chilly overcast to icy winds as we ventured through the districts. Never leave home without a jacket!  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting off from a bike rental in Haight-Ashbury, we proceeded west into the lovely Golden Gate Park. Approximately 5 km in length from east to west, the park is a wonderfully diverse habitat that features playgrounds, walking and biking trails, sports fields, flower gardens, and more.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2012/2012-09-17+04.08.01.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Slow going through Golden Gate Park&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the middle of the park we encountered the California Academy of Sciences, which was featuring a free entry day. Unfortunately, our idle plans to drop by the Academy was stymied by the extraordinary line that snaked out of the entrance and down the road. Looks like Americans are just as enamoured of free things as Australians are!  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Passing a soccer match and a wedding on our way out of the park, we found ourselves at Ocean Beach. By now we had passed out of the glorious sunshine and into the fog, and the beach was about the most pitifully sad that I've ever seen (though I'm told there are parts of the year when there is less fog). There was a stiff, cold breeze blowing, and few people felt the need to brave the conditions (though several dedicated surfers valiantly tried to make the most of it).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2012/IMG_0221.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Gloomiest beach ever&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From here we encountered San Francisco's most annoying feature for cyclists: hills. Riding north from Ocean Beach was a long, uninterrupted hill proceeding past Land's End (where I had chowder for lunch, yum!) and into the Richmond district. We climbed and climbed and climbed, until we reached the inevitable downhill run. And what a run it was.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2012/IMG_0224.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dedication to grid layouts in American cities is in complete contrast to the crazed mess that is the Sydney road network. Hills or no hills, the roads continue straight along in their lines.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pedaling up more hills along the Lincoln Boulevard, we finally arrived at the Golden Gate Bridge. Celebrating its 75th anniversary this year, the bridge is an absolutely stunning sight.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2012/DSC06413.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Random aside: why is the Golden Gate Bridge not coloured gold? It's because it's named after the strait that it crosses: the Golden Gate. So across the bridge and back again we rode, buffeted by the strong winds blowing through the Gate. It was such that we could actually see the famous Bay fog streaming out towards the ocean above the bridge. Possibly the most incredible part of the whole bike ride.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we rode south and east from the bridge, through the Marina section (where one of my compatriots crashed into a low concrete bollard and fell off, injuring his hand!). We finished at the Ferry Building near Embarcadero, having spent a very nice day of riding. I highly recommend this experience to anyone coming to San Francisco: but be prepared for hill climbing and all manner of weather conditions! &lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="San Francisco"></category><category term="Travel"></category><category term="California"></category><category term="Cycling"></category><category term="USA"></category></entry><entry><title>Fortuitous imaging and the iPhone 5</title><link href="http://dominickng.com/blog/2012/09/fortuitous-imaging-and-iphone-5/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-09-24T00:00:00+10:00</updated><author><name>Dominick Ng</name></author><id>tag:dominickng.com,2012-09-24:blog/2012/09/fortuitous-imaging-and-iphone-5/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;A couple of weeks ago I went camping at Big Sur, south of Monterey and Carmel on the California State Route 1. It was a lovely spot, and we spent time on a very windy beach, eating S'mores around a campfire, and enjoying being away from civilisation. A very American camping experience!  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we packed up and headed for home, we detoured south to the lovely &lt;a href="http://www.waterfallswest.com/waterfall.php?id=286"&gt;McWay Falls&lt;/a&gt; near the Julia Pfeiffer Burns National Park. The whole area is incredibly picturesque, and I took a few pictures. They included this one:&lt;/p&gt;

Fused together from British dialects, Aboriginal languages, American English, and other things we could find under the kitchen sink, it's turned into something of a unique lingo. And every now and again, I say something that causes the Americans in the room to give me a blank look, and laugh at my funny Australian ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, I learnt that Americans find it odd when you ask to "hire" an inanimate object. I had inquired about a "tent hire", and got some laughs in return. It turns out that you "hire" taxis, gardeners, and landscape designers, but you "rent" tents, movies, and equipment. Left to my own devices, I would use the two words interchangeably, but that's not so over here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2012/Vowels-cartoon-420x0.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Image by Matthew Martin, from &lt;a href="http://www.smh.com.au/national/its-all-english-but-vowels-aint-voils-20100125-mukf.html"&gt;http://www.smh.com.au/national/its-all-english-but-vowels-aint-voils-20100125-mukf.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My pronunciation has also caused some problems. Just before I left Australia, I had to spend a long time on the phone to a US call centre (US telcos.... they're a whole new story... ). Part of the process required spelling out my name, and I was confused as to why the operator kept getting it wrong. "D... o... m..", I would say, and "D... &lt;strong&gt;r&lt;/strong&gt;... m..." would be repeated back. This happened about five times in a row. It seems the Australian "o" (like in &lt;strong&gt;oh&lt;/strong&gt; dear), said with a downward intonation, is practically indistinguishable from the American "r". Meanwhile, the American "o" is said with an upwards intonation, like I'm asking a question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, there are some terms which are just plain different between American and (Australian) English...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You fill cars with gas (petrol)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wear flip-flops (thongs) on your feet - this one is &lt;strong&gt;really&lt;/strong&gt; bad, since "thongs" are rather skinny bikini bottoms in America...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mix peppers (capsicum), napa cabbage (Chinese cabbage), craisins (cranberries), raisins (sultanas), green onions (shallots), and arugula (rocket) to make a salad&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Attend college/school (uni) as an freshman/sophmore/junior/senior (first/second/third/fourth year)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consider life as a grad student (PhD candidate) after undergrad&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not to mention spelling color (colour), odor (odour), and humor (humour) in the right way&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given that my PhD work is in language, I find many of these quirks fascinating. It's amazing how you can speak structurally the same language, but with all gradients of accents, lexical choices, and morphological variations. I'm fully expecting to find even more of these as I go.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Language"></category><category term="Australia"></category></entry><entry><title>College football</title><link href="http://dominickng.com/blog/2012/09/college-football/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-09-02T00:00:00+10:00</updated><author><name>Dominick Ng</name></author><id>tag:dominickng.com,2012-09-02:blog/2012/09/college-football/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Here in Berkeley I'm living in the &lt;a href="http://ihouse.berkeley.edu/"&gt;International House&lt;/a&gt; (affectionately known as I-House). I've previously lived in the International House at Sydney (which we called IH), and sometime soon I'll write more about these places. But earlier today I attended my first college football match, courtesy of some free tickets from I-House. It was the opening game of the season - the California Golden Bears playing at home in Berkeley against Nevada.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I know that college football is a thing here. But I wasn't prepared for just how much of a thing it would be. I-House Berkeley is situated right next to &lt;a href="http://stadium.berkeley.edu/"&gt;California Memorial Stadium&lt;/a&gt;, which has just been rebuilt from the ground up. This was the homecoming match for the stadium and the Bears, who had played in San Francisco last year. As I strolled out of I-House, here was the sight that greeted me:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were people &lt;em&gt;everywhere&lt;/em&gt;. It seemed like half the population of Berkeley was streaming up the road and into the massive stadium - families, older folk, university students alike. And that was nothing compared to inside...  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2012/DSC06309.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over 63,000 people turned up to the game. By way of reference, UC Berkeley only has 36,000 students, and the vast majority of people I saw in the streets were just members of the public. As an Australian, having this many people show up to a inter-university sports match is mind-boggling.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The match itself was an error-strewn affair befitting the opening game of the season. The Bears quickly found themselves in a 14-0 hole thanks to some sloppy defence in the first quarter. However, they eventually found some momentum and engineered an exciting comeback to tie the game at 24-24 with 5 minutes left. But critical errors by the Bears in the dying stages of the game allowed Nevada to score a decisive final touchdown to win 31-24 and disappointing the home crowd.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also somewhat disconcerting to me was just how long American football takes. There's 60 minutes of game time, divided into 4 quarters. But the match took 3 hours 45 minutes to finish! So many things that happen on-field can stop the game clock, and when you throw in a half-time show, timeouts, team strategising, and more, a game really does eat the whole afternoon away. However, the atmosphere was electric, and the crowd was heavily involved throughout. I had a lot of fun, and I'm sure I'll attend more matches this year. Go Bears! &lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Berkeley"></category><category term="American Football"></category></entry><entry><title>Things that people don't realise about Australia (I)</title><link href="http://dominickng.com/blog/2012/09/things-that-people-dont-realise-about/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-09-02T00:00:00+10:00</updated><author><name>Dominick Ng</name></author><id>tag:dominickng.com,2012-09-02:blog/2012/09/things-that-people-dont-realise-about/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;As I meet people from all over America and the world, it's fun addressing some common misconceptions about my homeland. I thought that I'd jot down a few of my favourites so far, and add to the list as it grows.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Australia has 22.5 million people, but roughly the same landmass as continental USA. We're the sixth largest country by landmass in the world, but we have less than 4 people per square kilometre (that's a square with sides of roughly 1100 yards for the imperial folk).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt;Image from &lt;a href="http://petergrantfineart.wordpress.com/2010/06/21/the-size-of-australia-vs-usa/"&gt;http://petergrantfineart.wordpress.com/2010/06/21/the-size-of-australia-vs-usa/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2. Despite stereotypes, over 80% of Australians live within 100km of the coast, and the country is one of the most urbanised in the world. This is mostly due to the fact that vast tracts of the country are borderline uninhabitable.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. We harvest, consume, and export one of our national animals, the kangaroo.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. Hardly anyone (at least, in my experience) uses the phrase "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shrimp_on_the_barbie"&gt;shrimp on the barbie&lt;/a&gt;".  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5. The capital is Canberra, a city created because Sydney and Melbourne couldn't agree on which one should be the capital, and compromised with neither.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6. We're possibly the only country that has "misplaced" our national leader. In 1967, Prime Minister Harold Holt went for a swim at the beach and disappeared in heavy surf. The police, army, navy, and air force were all called in for a massive search, but to this day no trace of him as been found. Rumours persist that he was a Chinese spy returning to a submarine off the coast, abducted by a UFO, or running away with a mistress. (In all likelihood, he drowned).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7. We memoralised Holt by naming a swimming pool after him. You can't make this stuff up. &lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Australia"></category></entry><entry><title>First steps</title><link href="http://dominickng.com/blog/2012/08/first-steps-today-im-re-entering-space/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-08-27T00:00:00+10:00</updated><author><name>Dominick Ng</name></author><id>tag:dominickng.com,2012-08-27:blog/2012/08/first-steps-today-im-re-entering-space/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today I'm re-entering a space that I left some time ago. Many years ago, back in school, we had an assignment to maintain a blog, and post interesting things on it. Unfortunately, the site hosting my blog met the way of a server crash, and that data all disappeared. I've stayed off the blogosphere since then.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've now reached a point where I think it's important to write more stuff down. I don't feel like I'm a forgetful person, but I find myself getting to the end of most days and not remembering all of the interesting things that I did, or conversations I had, or sights I saw. With life full of many meetings, greetings, thoughts, views, and people, everything kind of ends up in a blur.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, by way of introduction: I'm a PhD candidate in computer science at the &lt;a href="http://sydney.edu.au/"&gt;University of Sydney&lt;/a&gt;, Australia. I work in &lt;em&gt;natural language processing&lt;/em&gt;, a subfield of artificial intelligence focused on understanding human languages with computers. Prior to this I completed a Bachelor of Information Technology degree, with Honours majoring in computer science.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the 2012-2013 year I was awarded a &lt;a href="http://fulbright.com.au/"&gt;Fulbright scholarship&lt;/a&gt;, a prestigious award that has given me the opportunity to spend a year at &lt;a href="http://berkeley.edu/"&gt;UC Berkeley&lt;/a&gt; in California. As I type this, I'm about to clock up three weeks in the United States. I think I'm settled in now; it's time to get stuck into things.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm aiming to record some of my experiences as a first-time Statesider, a Fulbright grantee, a computer science grad student in the Bay Area, and an Australian who's a long way from home. I'll muse about things that interest me (and hopefully you, dear reader). Hopefully I'll learn something about myself posting here to. Here goes.  &lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Berkeley"></category></entry></feed>
