It's been a very busy few months for me through the end of 2013 and the first
half of 2014; so apologies for the tardiness of this post.</p>


<figure class="image">

</figure>

<p>Boston is deeply stepped in the history of the United States. The final day of
my East Coast trip was spent exploring some of the rich heritage of the city,
and learning a little more about some of the pivotal moments that defined the
identity of the country. I rose early, and left Steph's house to track down
breakfast, which was to be a pastry at a local cafe. On the way there,
I passed by this nondescript looking town house with the proud flag out the
front. My host had told me the day before that this was the home of John
Kerry, former Senator for Massachusetts and current Secretary of State in the
Obama Administration. Kerry is an extremely wealthy man (married to the
heiress of the Heinz canned food empire), so I found it somewhat touching that
his house was so humble.</p>
<p>My hunger sated, the first order of this day would be walking the Freedom
Trail. The Trail is a 4km path red brick-marked path leading from the Boston
Common past several historic sites dating mostly from the American Revolution.
My friend Jonathan in Berkeley had provided me with a handy podcast that would
recount the significance of each site as I strolled by. It took a solid four
hours to walk the entire trail: between the history in my ears and the fact
that many sites were open to the public, inviting additional attention beyond
a mere glance. The podcast painted a fascinating picture of early Boston and
the rumblings of revolution, stripping away the modernity and taking me back
hundreds of years to the city of yesteryear.</p>
<figure class="image">
  <img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2014/east-coast-ii-boston-day-2/massachusetts_state_house.jpg">
</figure>

<p>The second stop of the Trail was the Massachusetts State House, now the state
capitol and seat of government. The glorious golden dome was originally wood
and leaky; it gained a copper waterproofing before finally being covered in
gold leaf in 1874, nearly 100 years after the building was first constructed.</p>
<figure class="image">
  <img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2014/east-coast-ii-boston-day-2/sam_adams.jpg">
</figure>

<p>Intertwined as its history is with that of the United States, Boston's many
graveyards are littered with historic figures. The Granary Burying Ground on
Tremont Street is just down the road and around the corner from the State
House, so named due to the large granary which used to stand on the graveyard
site adjacent to the Boston Common. Gravestones small and large lie in densely
staggered rows through this relatively small space - it is estimated that
around five thousand people are buried here, even though there are just over
2,300 graves. Three signers of the Declaration of Independence (Samuel Adams,
John Hancock, and Robert Treat Paine) are buried in this cemetery, along with
John Phillips, the first mayor of the city of Boston.</p>
<figure class="image">
  <img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2014/east-coast-ii-boston-day-2/franklin_obelisk.jpg">
</figure>

<p>The centre of the Granary Burying Ground is dominated by a giant obelisk
bearing the name, "Franklin". Whilst Benjamin Franklin, one of the Founding
Fathers of the United States, was born in Boston, he is buried in Philadelphia
in Pennsylvania. Instead, this obelisk marks the graveyard of some members of
Franklin's family.</p>
<figure class="image">
  <img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2014/east-coast-ii-boston-day-2/franklin_statue.jpg">
</figure>

<p>Just a block to the east of the Granary Burying Ground is Boston's oldest
cemetery, the King's Chapel Burying Ground. Dating back to 1630, this ground
is home to slightly lesser lights than the Granary. I passed quickly through
this cemetery, and moved on towards the First Public School site. This was the
first public school established in Boston and the United States, all the way
back in 1635! It really reminded me that, as much as I like to think the US as
a youthful country like Australia, my dear Down Under was colonised over 150
years after the States. Samuel Adams, John Hancock, Robert Treat Paine and
Benjamin Franklin all attended this school (though Franklin dropped out!), and
Franklin himself was born just one block away on Milk Street. In the courtyard
of the school stands a large statue of Franklin - perhaps one of the largest
tributes made in the grounds of a school to a drop-out.</p>
<figure class="image">
  <img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2014/east-coast-ii-boston-day-2/old_south_meeting_house.jpg">
</figure>

<p>The Old South Meeting House on Milk Street and Washington, is famous as the
organising location of the Boston Tea Party. In 1773, the British Parliament
passed the infamous Tea Act, which among other things levied a tax on tea
exported to the burgeoning American colonies. The colonists objected strongly
to this tax as it was collected by a government in which they had no
representation. Coining the slogan, "no taxation without representation",
anger over the tax grew, and a standoff erupted over the recently arrived tea
ships Dartmouth, Eleanor, and Beaver. Protestors prevented the tea from being
unloaded as thousands attended a meeting at the Old South Meeting House,
resolving to urge the captains of the ship to simply return the cargo to
Britain without paying the tax. As the stand off continued, a large group of
men disguised themselves as Indians, boarded the three ships, and threw all of
the tea into the harbour. The Boston Tea Party would become the spark that
would escalate into the American Revolution, and it remains an oft-cited act
in political protests to this day. More negatively, it has been embraced by
some extremely conservative elements in American politics today, twisting its
legacy for political gain.</p>
<figure class="image">
  <img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2014/east-coast-ii-boston-day-2/old_state_house.jpg">
</figure>

<p>The Freedom Trail cuts into more modern Boston from the Old South Meeting
House, leading past a quaint red-brick building surrounded by tall
skyscrapers. This is the Old State House, the predecessor of the current State
House, and a critical venue for many of the ideas and events that sparked the
American Revolution. In 1770, a patrol of British soldiers were taunted into
firing their weapons into a crowd of civilians, killing five and injuring six
others. The incident became known as the Boston Massacre, and served to
further inflame tensions between the population of the burgeoning American
colonies and the British Parliamentary authority, leading to the start of the
American revolution five years later.</p>

  <img class="img-responsive" src="/images/2014/east-coast-ii-boston-day-2/paul_revere.jpg">
</figure>

<p>Winding through the centre of Boston and up to the north of the city leads you
to this dashing bronzed fellow on horseback. He is Paul Revere, an American
Revolutionary most famous for his midnight ride on April 18th 1775 to warn
colonial militias of incoming British forces. By this time, the American
Revolutionary War had begun, with the British forces based in Boston, and the
Revolutionaries establishing control over the rest of Massachussetts from
their base in Concord west of Boston. On that night, lanterns in the
North Church were set to inform militia forces in Charlestown of the troop
movements ('one if by land, two if by sea'), and Revere slipped across the
Charles River by rowboat</p>
