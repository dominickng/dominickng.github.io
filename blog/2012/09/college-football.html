    <p>Here in Berkeley I'm living in the <a href="http://ihouse.berkeley.edu/">International House</a> (affectionately known as I-House). I've previously lived in the International House at Sydney (which we called IH), and sometime soon I'll write more about these places. But earlier today I attended my first college football match, courtesy of some free tickets from I-House. It was the opening game of the season - the California Golden Bears playing at home in Berkeley against Nevada.  </p>
<p>Now, I know that college football is a thing here. But I wasn't prepared for just how much of a thing it would be. I-House Berkeley is situated right next to <a href="http://stadium.berkeley.edu/">California Memorial Stadium</a>, which has just been rebuilt from the ground up. This was the homecoming match for the stadium and the Bears, who had played in San Francisco last year. As I strolled out of I-House, here was the sight that greeted me:  </p>

<p>There were people <em>everywhere</em>. It seemed like half the population of Berkeley was streaming up the road and into the massive stadium - families, older folk, university students alike. And that was nothing compared to inside...  </p>

</figure>

<p>Over 63,000 people turned up to the game. By way of reference, UC Berkeley only has 36,000 students, and the vast majority of people I saw in the streets were just members of the public. As an Australian, having this many people show up to a inter-university sports match is mind-boggling.  </p>
<p>The match itself was an error-strewn affair befitting the opening game of the season. The Bears quickly found themselves in a 14-0 hole thanks to some sloppy defence in the first quarter. However, they eventually found some momentum and engineered an exciting comeback to tie the game at 24-24 with 5 minutes left. But critical errors by the Bears in the dying stages of the game allowed Nevada to score a decisive final touchdown to win 31-24 and disappointing the home crowd.  </p>
<p>Also somewhat disconcerting to me was just how long American football takes. There's 60 minutes of game time, divided into 4 quarters. But the match took 3 hours 45 minutes to finish! So many things that happen on-field can stop the game clock, and when you throw in a half-time show, timeouts, team strategising, and more, a game really does eat the whole afternoon away. However, the atmosphere was electric, and the crowd was heavily involved throughout. I had a lot of fun, and I'm sure I'll attend more matches this year. Go Bears! </p>
